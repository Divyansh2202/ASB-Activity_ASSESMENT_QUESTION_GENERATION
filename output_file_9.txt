let's call my text hello world sothis string right here is what the textshould display right if we have atexture you have pushed this button thismany times that is a text right ifthat's a text the string data part isthis thing right here so that's whatI've typed in over here hello worldthen I'll put a semicolon over here saveit I'll ignore the warning for now alsoanything in blue underline is a warninganything with a red underline is awarning or is an error also anythingwith blue underline is a warning andanything with red underline is an erroryou can ignore warnings although youshouldn'tbut you cannot ignore errors because ifthere's an error your flutter app won'tbuild if there's a warning your flutterapp can still build but it's recommendedto fix the warnings before moving on andnow when we save it you see this thingright over herewe get a pop-up saying hot reloadcompleted what is this hot reload thinghot reload is when you have a small UItweak or some small change made in yourcode and then when you save the fileyou don't have to restart your entiresystem over here to see those changesin hot reload you can just save yourfile and it will display the small UItweaks present in your codeso you don't have to completely restartyour app and start everything fromscratch you can just save itand you'll be able to see the small UItweak if there is no small UI tweakthen you'll have to restart your app howdo we restart the app by clicking overhereon the city start button and as you cansee when we restart we getsome different kind of message over herewith red background this is an error allrightthe red warnings or the red underlinesdisplayed over here were compile timeerrors we've already known about that inthe dot sectionbut this ones are runtime errorsand you can also see runtime errors orcompile timeerrors when you press command Jin the debug console and you see they'vementioned the problem over herenowthese error messages also contain thestack Trace in the terminal over hereyou don't see the stack Trace what isstack Trace stack Trace basically allowsus to know where in our application theerror occurred because if ourapplication grows vast it can be a bitdifficult to know hey this is where theerror occurred right so stack Tracealready tells us hey you have a runtimeerror and this is where data code sothat's what text helps me withand as you can see the error is therelevant error causing widget was textokay so some error occurred related totext wireand then you have the exception Thronethis was the stack and this just goesdeep into the framework telling you heythis file this file this file this fileis where the error occurred but we don'thave to care that much about these linesbecause it's related to the frameworkand we'll anyways not be able tounderstand what's going onso we can just scroll up and you see thefollowing assertion was thrown buildingtext hello world so it's related to thisthing onlybut to be honest I don't understandanything that's mentioned over here butI do understand this thing nodirectionality widget found what doesthis directionality widget found meanit is at least legible English you knowbut still it's quite difficult tounderstand what's directionality widgetwith respect to this text widget wellthe point over here is this textrequires you to pass ina direction property we need to specifythe direction property over here becausewe need to specify the text position onthe screendo we want the text from to go from leftto right or do we want the text to gofrom right to left that's what we wantto figure out where on the screen shouldit be over here or over herethat's why it was giving us this errorso let's understand how we can fix thatand many a times you can fix the problemby looking at the properties of theparticular widget or the particular textclass and see if there is a propertyrelated to direction to fix itand the property is text direction rightand as you can see this is a namedargumentthe first thing was a positionalargument and after that we had namedarguments that were optionalso we can pass text Directionover here now you might ask if textdirection is necessary without textDirection it is giving us this errorwhy don't they make text Directionproperty non-optional as well just likedata rightif text direction is required in ourtext property without it it is giving usan error why do we want X direction tobe empty or nullable or optional thereason for that is most of the times youwon't be writing text widget like thisover here you'll be using somethingknown as material app that we are goingto look into in just a momentin just a while butthere direction for text is alreadydefined so you don't have to Define itover thereso it is optional but as of now just forme demoing basic flood or app to youit's requiredso for now you can blindly just put textDirection it will make much more sensewhen we have so as of now you can justput text Direction like thisblindly but later on you'll understandwhat I'm talking aboutwhen we start using material app andthose kind of stuffso we have X Direction over hereand this text Direction requires textDirection now is text Direction a classto understand that we have to presscommand and then we can go into the textDirection source code but it tellsnothing about text Directionwhy because this is the Constructor wehave to go to the place where textdirection is initialized sowe can click over text Direction andhere we are final text Direction whichis empty text Direction now tounderstand if text direction is a classor not we hover over thisand it tells us it's not a class it's anenumso text Direction can have a certainlimit of values now what are thosevalues you can again click command soyou go to the text Directionenum definition and here it isand it can have two values RTL or LTRand as you can see it's already definedover here with something known as
