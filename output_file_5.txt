dot IMLnothing we should be concerned aboutthen we have pubspec.log andpubspec.yamlso pubspect.yaml consists ofall the details of our flutter projectfor example the name of the project thedescription of the project then thisline which is related to pub.dev youremember the site where we went toinstall HTTP plugin so if we create ourown dot project and we want to publishit to pub.devthen we need to remove this line if weare only building a flutter appand that is not to be published onpub.dev we can keep this linethat we have the version number of ourFlorida project or the flutter appso if you have ever noticed everyapplication has a version attached to itso if you just click on an app and go toits app info you'll see the version forit for example the WhatsApp version asof now is 2.23.11.77that's what this version number allowsus to do it allows us to upload to AppStore Play Store and all the otherstores without creating the confusionthat two projects are similar or thesame so you can have unique versionsevery time you upload to app store orPlay Store then we have environment sothis tells us the flutter SDK we'll beusing in this project andthe hdk we are using is basicallygreater than or equal to 3.0.5 but lessthan 4.0.0 so you can use anything fromflutter 3 to flutter 4 over here and itwill obey all the rules you can alsodecrease your SDK so you can just puttwo over hereand it can be less than three so it willfollow all the rules related to flutter2 to flutter 3. but obviously you needto make sure that you have fluttered twoinstalled for that but it's always goodto stay on the latest SDK not on theprevious SDK because you need to keep upwith the advancements in your frameworkright if we have flutterwe always need to make sure that we areupdated to it so that we can use all itslatest featuresthen we add the dependencies tab and inthe dependency the first one we have isflutter which is coming from the flutterSDK itselfand we have the Cupertino icons theCupertino icons dependency can be foundon pub.devbut it basically allows us to use iOSstyled icons Cupertinoeverywhere in our flutter code is goingto relate to the iOS part so if you haveCupertino icons we have IOS style iconsthen we have Dev dependencies we alreadyknow what dependencies arewe have already installed a dependencynot DOT pad which was the HTTP Plugin orthe HTTP packagein-depth dependencies we havedependencies related to the developer soif developer needs anything that willhelpthe developer to you know write code andincrease productivity they can use thatbut it doesn't affect the user Behaviorat all okay so whatever you have overhere is just related to the developerhaving a better environment and here wehave the flutter lenspackage and the federal lens package isconnected to the analysis option.yamlwhich is our linter you can see includepackage flutter lens flutter.amlI know this might not make sense but weare just starting right now as we moveahead you'll understand what I'm talkingaboutthen we have flutter which says usersmaterial design to true then you havesomething related to assets we'll getinto it then we have something relatedto fonts as well we'll get into itand that's pretty much all aboutpubspec.yamlforeigncontains all the packages that we mighthave installedand keeps the track of the versionnumber the description from where itcame everythingand at last we have the readme.md so ifyou want anyone to read yourproject and you know you have certainguidelines to follow you can have areadme aware which tells everythingabout it and if you click on this iconall of this text away or translate tothis this is what dot MD represents MDis short for markdown so whenever youhave hashtag like this it thinks this isan H1 kind of title a bigger title thenyou have a normal text then you havetwo hashtags which is a smallerheaderthen you have smaller text then you havelinks and all of that stuffso this basically allowsany other engineer working on yourproject to read more about it and youknow understand how to contribute andall of that stuffso we can close this and we have two theentire flutter project now let's go tothe main.dot file which is where we aregoing to be 90 of the times not in themain.file but in the lip folder ingeneral we can create more dot files wecan do more things and 95 percent of thetimes you're just going to stay in theslip folder and not move out of itbecause this is where the entire flutterproject is cookedso yeah this is where we are main.dotfile now what I want to do is there's abunch of code written here by default Ijust want to run it but even beforerunning there are a few things I want todo for example you might not be able tosee this font so I just want to increasethe font size over here to increase it Iam going to press command shift psettingsthen click on open settingsclick on text editor over hereclick on font and here I can increase myfont size so my font size can be let'ssay 20click on enter come over here and itzoomed in a little bit too much so Ithink I'm going to go ahead with 18this is better but what about 17. Ithink 18 works well for me and I hopeyou're also able to see this I'm alsogoing to put this panel like this sothat my code gets more spaceand that looks cool now another problemthat I have here is the highlightingpart by highlighting I meanI just don't want my code Editor to lookblue whiteand just orange you know I want morecolors to be present if you look at takea look at dot pad you'll see extensionwhich of the keyword is in greenextension name is an orange color on isagain a keyword so green a data type soit's in white color again a data typeswhite color function or a variable nameis in blue color so I want a similarkind of highlighting to be present sothat it's easy for me to distinguishbetween dot stuff and a lot of
