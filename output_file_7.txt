not running in the background likeMac OS and chrome so we'll first have tostart the simulator and here we haveiPhone 14 pro Maxwhich is given to us by xcode so it'sloading right now we can also start ourpixel emulator so we'll just click onthisstart icon right here and thatwill launch as well and as you can seethe Mac OS part is running hereif I just expand thisis our Mac OS app and this is our webapp both of them look very similar rightalmost the samethat is because of flutteryou can run one code base so you havea consistent looking UI design on bothyourMac OS app and your Windows app and itworks the same way okay nothing isdifferent right here now we also haveour pixel emulator and iPhone radio sowe can run those as well and they'llworkside by side as well just make sure youhave the current device selected overhere so that you launch it over there ifI want to run it on iPhone I'll justclick on run run without debugging withiPhone selected aware if I want to runpixel I'll select pixel over here andrun it so whatever you select over hereand when you click over and run overherethat device will be run I hope that wasclear and if you click over here thereare four devices we are connected to andrunning at the same time if you presscommand J it opens the terminal you cango to the debug consoleyou have Macos over hereChrome right over herepixel 6 loading and iPhone loading aswellnow I don't like running all of theplatforms at the same time becausewe can lose out on a lot of battery veryquickly because we are running on fourplatforms togetherwhat I like to do is run on twoplatforms at the most so it can beiPhoneAndroid iPhone web depending on where Iwant to launch itso if I want to build an app only forAndroid and iOS it makes sense to onlyuse Android and iOS at the same time orif you're sure that it will have aconsistent UI design on both Android andiOS there will be no changesyou can just run it on one device if youwant to launch your app on all thedevicesor on all the platforms then you canjust have maybe a web platform and aniOS simulator runningso it really depends on you if you wantyour battery to get exhausted veryquicklyyou can go ahead and run on all the fourplatforms there's no problem with itso our iPhone process is almost done youcan see xcode well doneand it uses the impeller run renderingbackend we'll get into what impeller isbut if we just come over here here isour iPhone application and when we clickover here we are able to see the samething that we saw over here and here sowe are able to run our app on all theplatforms let's get done with theAndroid one as well it is installing abunch of things once it completesinstalling it will start running theapplication and thenwe can start designing our currencyconverter app from scratch and whileAndroid is being run let's take a lookat a few more things I want to get intofirst one is the file explorer tab overhere it looks very plain doesn't itwhat I want here is certain symbols tobe present so that I can distinguishbetween an iOS folder or a lib folderreally quickly so for that we have anextension which is called vs code iconsthere are a bunch of vs code extensionsrelated to file iconsbut my favorite one is vs code iconswhich you can click on install and itwill bring icons to your file explorerand here you see after you install it itsaid it asks you to select a file icontheme vs code icons or city which isprovided by Visual Studio code itself Iwant vs code icons because that's betterfor meI'll come over here and you see all ofmy folders now have a unique icon to itso we have Android which gives ussomething similar to Android build iOSso we have Apple logoLinux Mac OS testweb windows so everything has adifferent icon to it so I candistinguish between all of them reallyquickly and it just helps me overallalso I can see that the pixel emulatoris now workingso I can just come over here and therewe go we have our app showing here aswell so it looks similar on all theplatforms That's The Power of usingflutter so now what I'm going to do isexit from almost all the platforms justkeep one platform on the side so that Ihave a perspective of what's going on soI'll close Chrome I'll close Mac OS I'llclose pixel as wellI'll just keep the iPhone on the siderest all the things are now goneI can also close the Android emulator ifI want so I'll just select this click oncommand Qit will save the state and close thepixel emulator for us awesome now wejust have the is simulator here and nowwe can start preparing our currencyconverter app so this is where we aregoing to start writing real flutter andDot code so to begin our work on thecurrency converter app what I'm going todo is press command a so that I selecteverything present in the main.dot filethen I'm going to backspace everythingand we'll start writing everything fromscratch yes we are going to need a lotof components that are already mentionedover here these are sort of boilerplatecode meaning if you don't have them yourflutter app won't work properlyso you need to have them but we'll startwriting everything from scratch so thatwe understand why we need them in thefirst place for example the statelesswidget thing this material app thing allof those things right so let's backspaceitthen like every DART program we need tocreate a main function because that'sour entry point to the DART programso what happens is flutter just searchesfor main.dot file in lib folder when itgets main.dart it searches for the mainfunction in the main.dot file and thenyou can see we get these three optionsto run our app so now we have a simpledot program with us what we need to dois tell flutter
