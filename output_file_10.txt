or dot in the dot course wesaw that there are two types of commentsfirst one wassingle line comment another one wasmulti-line comment and this is a thirdtype of comment which is thedocumentation comment by documentationcomment what happens is whenever Iinitialize text direction or use textDirection and hover over it you'll see adefinitionor the description of this textDirection propertyand somewhere when you scroll you'll seethis thing right here the text flowsfrom right to left example Arabic Hebrewyou won't see that over here becausethis is present inside the enum but ifyou see documentation comments arepresent over here as well which isrelated to the text Direction so if wejust go at the topyou'll see a direction in which textflows some languages are written fromthe left to right so if you come overhere hover over this you'll see adirection in which text flows sobasically with documentation commentsyou'll be able to see some changes overheresome stuff or description written overhere which is quite nice because thenyou don't have to Google stuff up andunderstand what's required you can justlook at the source code and understandwhat's requiredso let's close this let's close this andlet's give text Direction upvalue and that will be text DirectionDot and we get Auto suggestion the autosuggestion is LTR or R2Land values is just a list or containingRTL or LTR so I'm just going to have LTRbecause I wanted to show up over hereleft to right so it will show upsomewhere over here then I'll save itbut if I come away a hot reload doesn'twork because this is quite a massivechangeso you'll have to restart your entireapp and then you'll be able to see HelloWorld over here we are not able to seeit properly but yeah it is written overtherenow if I just mention let's say fourexclamation marks save it I'm not seeingit again because this is a massivechangeso after I restart I'll be able to seeitbut later on when we start addingmaterial app and we make small UI tweaksyou'll be able to see the great power ofhot reload which is what makes fluttervery different from other Frameworksbecause many other Frameworks don't havethe support for hot reload and it'squite a wonderful feature in my opinionand now if I press RTL over here insteadof LTR and restart the app I see textover here and my exclamation marks goright in the right so that was abouttext and you know just displaying somestuff up but now let's get intomore complex things because obviously wedon't just want to return a text overhere andfor bigger apps this is not possible whybecause simple apps don't just show UIright they have many more things goingon in the back end it's not aboutdatabases of servers that I'm talkingaboutnot the back end related stuff I'mtalking about stuff likenavigation by navigation I mean movingfrom one page to another so if I haveone page then I want to move to anotherpagebigger apps can do that for exampleYouTube if I use youtube.com I see thehome page when I click on a video I'llgo to another page that contains thevideo player so bigger apps havemultiple pages in them and moving fromone page to another in an app is callednavigation just like moving from oneplace to another in real life is knownas navigating right so bigger apps havesupport for that and it can't be done byjust using text we need to use somethingelse which is known as material app orit can be Cupertino app now we are goingto dive into both of them but beforethat we'll have to understand some otherConcepts now you knowjust having a text widget isn't what areal app like real app will look like itwill have one screen of its own and inthat screen there are going to be manycomponents as well for example if youjust open google.com it's a very simplelooking page but it has a lot ofcomponents here first of all it has theheader right up at the top Gmail imagesall of this stuff then it has the Googlelogo over here then it has the textfield that takes our input then it hastwo buttons then it has this thing whichhelps us in Translation then it hasfooter and that too two Footers I guessso it has a lot of components and influtter every component can be a widgetright so if you're coming from otherFrameworks like react you already knowwhat components are whatever UI buildingblock is there and in flutter widgetsare components my point is that this appwill grow into something big that willhave many components on the screen sowhat I want to do is make sure my app isbroken down into several smaller widgetsso that more Engineers can work on it atthe same time just imagine my entire apppresent in this function right here Ican do that it's totally possible so Ican build my entire app all the widgetslet's say the entire Google Chromescreen I can build in this function butdo you think that's feasible because itis it will become such a big thing rightit will have like hundreds and thousandsof lines of code all enclosed withinthis function so I obviously want tobreak it down so that more Engineers canwork your net togetherand when it's broken down you can allotdifferent files to it different classesto it and Engineers can work on net atthe same time and it will boostproductivity so that's what I want to doI want to segregatethis text widget in a widget of its ownthat won't have any UI change but itwill definitely have a productivityboost for our applicationso let's go ahead and create our owncustom widgetnot custom widget but our own widget andwe can do that by creating a classbecause widgets at the end of the dayare classes if you press command go tothe text definition you'll see text is aclass as well and it extends somethingknown as stateless widget to become awidgetso we need to do the same thingmy widget is going to be named as my appnothing too fancy therebecause if I name this as text then itwill be a problem rightbecause then it will get confused
