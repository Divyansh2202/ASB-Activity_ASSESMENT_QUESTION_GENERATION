in this course we are going to learn tobuild apps for multiple platforms likeAndroid iOS web and desktop from asingle code base using the flutterframework this course is designed forabsolute beginners infiniter however Ihighly recommend you to watch the dartbeginners course present on the channelas this course requires a strongunderstanding of Dart this course solelyfocuses on flutter app development anddoes not cover any database relatedtopics we'll create three apps in thiscourse first one is a simple currencyconverter app to get started second isthe weather app where all the weatherdata is being fetched from the web andthe last one is a shopping appby building these three apps we learnvarious aspects of flutter such aswidgets layouts responsive layouts StateManagementEtcadditionally I'll provide you with abrief overview of the inner workings offlutter like understanding how flutterhandles rendering State Management andmore behind the scene stuff I've covereddatabase related topics in separatetutorials which you can easily followalong after watching this tutorialbefore starting this course I'd like tothank RF Islam for providing me with theUI of the shop app and Tomic reader andIsmail Alam Khan for helping me set upthe curriculum of this course now let'sget started by installing flutter so toinstall flutter you need to make sureyou're on this website flutter.dev thenyou can click on docs install flutterand then you'll see a bunch of optionsto select the operating system on whichyou want to install flutter so if youare on Windows or Linux you can clickeither of them and if you're on Mac youcan click on Mac OS now I won't be ableto cover the windows and Linuxinstallation processes because I don'thave either of those systemshowever there's one thing I'd like tomention that if you just click over hereyou'll get the entire installationprocess and most of it is similar to theinstallation process on Mac OS so weneed to get the flutter SDK we need todo the Android setup and if there'sanything we can do the Windows setup aswell but one thing you need to doadditional is install git if you haven'talready so for flutter you need to havegit pre-installed in your system so youcan click on open a new tab and downloadthe get installer from here depending onyour system you can either install this32-bit or this which is 64-bit after youhave the installer you can double clickon it and run it then follow all theprocesses the wizard gives you and thenyou'll have get installed in your systemto check if it is installed or not youcan go to your system and just type getif you see something like this it meansget us installedif it isn't then you haven't installedit properly you need to make sure thatit's installed properly all right solet's clear this off andone last thing to mention over here iswhen you have the Windows installationprocess you cannot do iOS setup becauseyou cannot build apps for iOS from aWindows machine you can only build appsfor Android web and windows from aWindows operating system you can buildfor Android web and Linux from a Linuxoperating system but you cannot buildfor iOS or Mac OS from Windows or Linuxso that's a point to know that's why ifyou see a wire you don't have IOS setupwritten over herehowever if you come to Windows or Mac OSinstallation you'll see iOS setup herewe have xcode which already includes getwhich means we don't have to install gitseparately on Mac all right you can seeit away flutter users get forinstallation and upgrade we recommendinstalling xcode which includes get butyou can also you install git separatelyall right so we are just going toinstall it with xcode I already have itinstalled it doesn't make any differencebut if you don't have git installedwe'll install it when we install xq sonow let's dive into this so the firstpart is to get the flutter SDKso to get the flutter SDK depending onwhat Mac you have Intel Mac or applesilicon Mac you can select either ofthese buttonssince I am on an M1 chip I'm just goingto click over here and it will start theinstallation process for me on Windowsalso the first part is to get theflutter SDK you'll get only one buttonto install the flutter SDK on Windowsafter that you need to extract the filein the desired locationso you need to make sure one particularfolder where you can install it for me Ialready know where I want to do it so ifI go to found finder press command shiftGthen just a forward slash so I go toMacintosh HDput it in a grid format so that it'sbetter to seewhere I want to install flutter is usersdriven ranavat and over here all rightso from the root of my laptop I want togo to users everyone ranavat and hereI'll have the flutterfolder or extract so once theinstallation is complete which I thinkis complete I'll drag it over here soI'll just open a new finder which hasdownloadsI'll have flutter over here I'll drag itover here in my advantra now with folderand there we have flutter right herecool now the next step is to add theflutter tool to our path now we can justcopy this Command put it in the terminaland run it and then we'll be able to useflutter specific commands like flutterdoctorbut now you can see flutter command isnot find because I've not run thiscommand and if I run this commandmeaning I add flutter tool to my paththen run it so it will locate flutterdoctor so it will know what fluttercommand is but when I exit the terminalreopen the terminal again it will forgetthe flutter command because it only setsthe path for the current terminal windowit doesn't set it for the entireterminal or for the entire systemit only does for one windowso to permanently add it we have toclick a wire which is permanentlyupdating a path and follow the stepswritten over hereso the first step is to determine thepath of our clone of the flutter SDKso we already know where it is from theroot of our folder we need to go to theusersflutter bin so this is our path allright then we need to
