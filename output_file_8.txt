to come into action andstart running the app so how can we dothat to do that we have a simplefunction given by the flutter SDK itselfwhich is run up because we want to runthe app rightso we'll pass and run up over here whichis a function coming from some importline like this so as soon as we had runapp over here it automatically importedthis line right here now what is thisline well let's break this down we haveimport so it's importing some packagesome file someother project some other folder and thatis the flutter packageand in Florida package it's thematerial.dot now you might say hey thisline seems very similar to what we hadin the dart section we had importpackage HTTPhttp.dot this was the case because wewere importinghttp.dot file from HTTP package we aredoing the same thing over here but withflutter we are importing thematerial.dot file from the flutterpackage if you're curious how we areimporting package flutterif you just go to the pubspect.aml filedependencies this is where all thedependencies come inso anything extra your app depends onthat is not related to Dot comes in overhere so we have the flutter dependencyover here and this is coming from SDKphiladelunlike Cupertino underscore icons thatis coming from pop.devunlike the HTTP package that was comingfrom pub.dev this flutter is coming fromthe SDK flutterand what is this SDK flutter well it'sthe same thing that you installed onyour system locally and it's good tomention SDK flutter like this and notgive any path to it because the path ofthe flutter can changemaybe you reinstall it somewhere else sojust having SDK flutter like this is abetter thing so we can closepubspect.aml file and when we again comeover here we can see package flutter isimported and from there we are importingthe material.dart file why material.dotfile because material.dot file gives usmany of flutters functions classesmethods that we can use for example therun app file or the run app functionbecause in Dart we don't have anythinglike run appin Dart we have already seen we havestuff like string and all of thatstuff like stringinteger Boolean async keyword all ofthis can be used without importing theflutter library or the flutter packagebut stuff like run app cannot be runwithout importing flutter all rightand to import flutter you need to haveflutter installed and you need to makesure that in perspect.aml file you havethe dependency present so again comingback to run app so this import lineright here is quite important and you'llsee later on how many times thismaterial.dot is used in your flutter appit's almost used in every single fileyou create because it also gives youaccess to certain widgetsor certain UI things which is quitehelpful so now coming back to the runapp function what exactly is this run upfunction if you just hover over thisyou'll see the definition of thisfunction it is void run appand then it requires a parameter ofwidget appso that means an app is not returninganything and it requires something knownas widget app and since we don't knowwhat widget is that is not even a DOTrelated thing so that means widget isagain something created by flutter teamthemselves it's a thing in flutter so itmight be a custom class that theycreated but we are still not sure so tounderstand this what you can do is presscommandso you can click on run app thenand when you click over here you getdiveinto the flutter source code as you cansee over here users Advance are not slotup so I'm going into the flutter SDKthat I installed locally on my system totake a look at this definition andunderstand what this widget thing isand as you can see when I go in thedefinition when I hover over widget itsays that it's an abstract class widgetand we already know what abstractclasses areagain if you want to take a look at thedefinition of widget you can presscommand again and then click on widgetand you'll dive into the source code ofabstract class widgetbut we are not diving into the fluttersource code nowI just wanted to show this to you let'snot make things complicatedso now this requires something known asa widget what is this widgetwidgets are the building blocks of theuser interface they are responsible fordescribing what the UI should look likeso let's take an example of the counterapp over here if I want to describe thathey in my app I want the header likethisa pink or purple kind of background withsome text on it then I want some textsover here then I want a button over hereand on that button I want this plus typeof icon to be displayed so all of thesethings are widgets because they describewhat my screen what my user interface isgoing to look likeso that's exactly what we want to passto run appand this widget can be literallyany UI component right so I can just putin a text which is again provided byflutter material.dot and you have toinstantiate that text text again is aclass if you press command and go to thetext definition you'll see it is a classtext all right and also one thing that Ididn't mention please don't changeanything over hereif you change anything in the fluttersource code it will behave differentlyfor you over here and that can cause alot of problemsso take this as a read-only file if youjust want to take a look at what's goingon inside and you're just curious ingeneralbut do not edit it anything at allbecause if it stopsbehaving the way you want it to you'llhave to reinstall everything and thatcan be quite a headache unnecessarilyso you can close this nowso now we have the text over here andthat is a widgetso this text requires us to pass in adata as you can see whenever weinstantiate a classit tells us what all stuff is requiredin this textand the thing that's required over hereis string data and that is a positionalargument that's why we are getting theerror over here saying one positionalargument expected by text Dot Nu butzero foundwe've already seen these kind of errorsin the dot sectionso let's pass a string over hereand
