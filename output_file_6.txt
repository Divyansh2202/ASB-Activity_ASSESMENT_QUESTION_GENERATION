stuff allrightso for that I can again press commandshift ptype preferences and I'll find somethinglike color theme over here I just needto click it and change the theme overhere so if I change the team to darkPlusyou see there is a colored change overherenow it's not no longer just white andblue it has multiple colors over hereblue is a keyword a class name has greencoloragain this is a keyword widgetis a class built as a function so it hasall of the properhighlighting that I wantednow the next step is to run the defaultcode that is provided by flutter andjust take a look at how flutter lookswhen it just creates a project for usand we do absolutely nothingso for this how can we run well we canjust go to the Run tab run withoutdebugging and it tells us that we don'thave an extension for debugging dotshould we find a DOT extension in themarketplace you can click over here butI'm just going to click on a cancelbecause I know what to doit's not the DOT extension that we arelooking for we are looking for somethingrelated to fluttervs code tells that because we are in adart file it doesn't know that we arerunning a flutter related project so wedon't need to find a extension specificto dot we need to find an extensionspecific to flutterso we'll go to the extensions tab overhere type flutter click on enterand it gives us the extension flutterwhich is provided by the dot team or theGoogle team itself we can just click oninstall awareand what this will do is basicallyprovide us with a set of tools whichwill allow us to edit refactor run anddebug our applicationsand when we install the flutterextension another extension that we getby default is the dart extension becauseflutter included Dotso it only makes sense to include thedart extension as wellnow we can come over here close thisextension go to the main.dot file andyou see we have a new bulb icon showingup here then we have run debug profilethree buttons right hereon the right hand side we have devicesshowing up where we can select from MacOS Chrome IO simulator or pixel emulatorwhich is the Android emulatorsince we installed xcode we got accessto iOS simulator since we installedAndroid Studio it defaultcreatedthe pixel emulator if you don't seepixel emulator over here you can just goahead and create your own Androidemulator all right and if you see anerror like this what you need to do isjust go to Android studio right hereclick on more actions virtual devicemanagerand click on create a device select thephone that you want from your let's saypixel 4 XLor let's go ahead with pixel 6 then weclick on next we'll use the API 34 thedefault one if you want to change theAPI so let's say you want to useAndroid or Android s whatever you canuse that I'm going to go ahead with theAPI 34.click on next then we have pixel 6 API34all the default optionsif you want you can change the Androidadvance settings as well where you canchange the ramthe virtual memory Heap the internalstorage so we can change the internalstorage to GB and let's say550 GBwhatever you want I'm just kidding youknow just have 20 GB like this thenclick on finish and that creates anemulator for you if you want to run ityou can just click on thislaunch icon or you can just come overhere and you'll see the pixel 6 API 34emulator scene over hereand if you want to default remove thedefault pixel emulator that it createdfor you you can go ahead and click onthese three options delete and it willdelete it for youso let's delete it we only want to keepjust one emulator over here and if weagain go to the devices the device is nolonger there there's just pixel 6 API34.so let's go ahead and run theproject so where do we want to run itwell we want to run it on let's sayChromeso we'll select the Chrome device overherethen we'll click on run and it willstart running it for youyou see there are a bunch of things thathappened here it opened the debugconsole so it is launching lib slashmain.dot on Chrome and debug mode sothis tells us a thing about flutter andDot by default it goes to the lib slashmain dot dot file to run the project sothis is the first file to get executedin after projectthen we have this settings thing righthere it gives us a bunch of settingsover here for example if you want topause the debugging if you want torestart your application if you want tohot reload your application if you wantto stop it so if you stop it this thingright here will get executedexited so if you close thisyou see the web application is now goneso again let's click on run and it willstart running it for you and we alsohave this search icon which is widgetinspector page so if you click over hereit doesn't start anything right now butagain if you click over here it willopen the widget inspector widgetinspector is a kind of thing that allowsyou to see how your application isstructured but we'll get to it later onbecause you don't know what widgets areright so let's close thisand there we go we have a floss flutterapp right here we have this good lookingapp and this increment button if I clickover here it just increases this thingright here so it's a very basic apprunning on web if you want to run moreapps you can do it simultaneously so youcan open it and run it on Mac OS soclick on run your run without debuggingwhich is another way to run your flutterapps you can either do it over here youcan either do it over here or you canjust run the command flutter Run Okay sothat works as wellso let's just click on run over here aswell which opens it on Mac OS so we haveour application running on Chrome andMac OS bothwe can also run three apps in one placeso we'll start the iOS simulator firstbecauseit's
