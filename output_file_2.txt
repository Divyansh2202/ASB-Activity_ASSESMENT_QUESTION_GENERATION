open or create theRC file for your shell then we need totype this command in the terminal solet's go ahead and copy itso we have slash bin slash zshtyping this command gives us access towhat shell we are using IV using bash orare we using search shell since it givesus the output as zsh it means we areusing that shell so I need to edit thispart right here okay so I'll just copyit then over here I'm going to type Vimwhich is kind of like a code editor soif I just put themlike this I'll be able to edit out zshrcfile right here in the Vim code editor Ican also type Nanoinstead of Vim followed by dollar homeslash Dot zshrc and that will open it inNano but I'm more comfortable with whimso I'm going to go ahead and use itnow the final step is to copy this lineand paste it over here so here we needto mention the path of the flutter getdirectory where is it it's in usersso we canbackspace over here but when I try tobackspace you see I just go in the lefthand side it's not actually deletinganything so to delete it we have topress X so it will start erasing stuffthen you can backspace everything andpaste this line right here all right sowe have export path is equal todouble inverted comma dollar path colonslash user slash this is where we havestored right slash user slasher and runout slash flutterslash bin all right thenthat's pretty much it now we can pressenterthen we can have colon W click on enterthat saves the file then we'll havecolon queue a and we exert them likethisnow if we run the command again you'llsee we have this line written right overhere that's good so it has saved itsuccessfully and we have successfullyadded it to our path as well now we needto run this command so that we refreshthe current window to see our you knowchanges if flutter command is working ornot or we can just open a new terminalwindow so I'm just going to close thisI'm going to create a new terminal andthen I need to run this command toverify that the flutter pathflutter bin directory is now in our pathso we can run this and we see usersrewind out flutter bin that's great nowI can clear this off now I need toverify if the flutter command is workingor not so I'll copy this paste it overhere and there we gothis gives us the location of ourflutter folderthis is where it's located right usersflutter bin flutter right this thingright hereso we have successfully installedflutter to our system if you're onWindowsafter updating your path which ismentioned in the documentation youshould be able to run which fluttercommand and see the correct output ifyou do that means flutter installedsuccessfully now we can just run theflutter doctor command which gives us alist of things now that we need to focuson and flutterdoctor gives me a list ofthings so it's kind of like a realdoctor it tells you what all is notthere what all is missing and this iswhat you need to do so Shredder isinstalled we are on 3.10.5 which is thelatest version as of June 21. now thenext
