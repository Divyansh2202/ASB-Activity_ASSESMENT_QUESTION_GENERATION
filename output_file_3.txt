over thereand then click on OK click on okay overhere that will install it and we aredoneso we can close this let's again runflutterdoctor commandand you see that issue is resolved nowwe now only need to accept the Androidlicenses that we haven't so we can runthis command and it will do that we justneed to put it in the same line and runit and then it works all right soyeah we'll review the licenses that havenot been accepted then we'll click yesyes yes yesand there we go so we have been acceptedall the licenses so I hope everything isworking fine for Android now so we'llrun flutter doctor and everythingrelated to Android is also fixed now nowthe last step is xcode developed for iOSand Mac OSso the final step that's required is forxcode so we need to develop for iOS andMac OS we can do that by going to theApp Store and installing xcode or justgo into the web download I'll go to theApp Store and install itso I'll wait for xcode to install andthen we can focus on the stuff that'smentioned later on so I'll see you whenxcode is installed completely on thesystem all right so xcode has installedon our system I'll just click on openhere so we like to build for Mac OS andiOS so I'm just going to click oninstall here I'll have to enter mypassword and then it will startinstalling additional components afterthat we need to configure the xcodecommand lines tools to use the newlyinstalled version of xcode so we canjust copy this linethen click on enter again we'll have toenter a password over here and we aredone then we can again run this commandpaste itso this is great I think we'veconfigured xcode for nowone last command is left which is thispseudo xcode build licensewe'llpress space for moreand then we just need to type agree tosay that we are agreeing and we are donenow we can clear this off run flutterdoctor and see if it is done properly ornotso one issue from xcode is gone now wejust need to install cocoapod which isnot installed so to install it we canjust go to their guide the link that ismentioned over herepaste itand to install Coco pod we just need torun this command sudogem installcocoapodsso we have installed cocoapods now wecan again run the flutterdoctor commandand as you can see no issues found thatmeans the entire flutter installation issuccessful so if you've covered thispart and everything works fine it's allgood now the last stepis to install vs codeso if you just type in vs code installyou'll see this websitecode.visualstudio.com so this isbasically our code editor this is wherewe are going to write our code type itall out in the dart course we had useddotpad.dev now we don't need to use thatanymorewe're going to write on our system onlyso we are going to use our PCand here we have Visual Studio code thatwill help us to you knowdebug writer code it will help us andbasically everythingso you can install it according to yourplatform again I'm just going to goahead with the Apple silicon zip fileand it will start installing it for meafter I have vs code installed I'll juststart creating a flutter project andwe'll create a first app that is thecurrency converter app so vs code is nowinstalled you can see it and downloadsI'm just going to click on the smallsearch icon over hereso it shows that Visual Studio code isin the download I'm just going to dragthis to the applications tab because vscode is an application then double clickon itthen click on openand we have vs code right here I'm goingto browse the color themes and selectwhich one I prefer I don't prefer thedark high contrast it looks very weirdin my opinionobviously notlight modern color we can use this oneor you can go ahead look for more themesso now that we have Visual Studio codeinstalled let's go ahead and open it soI'll have Visual Studio code Type likethis and open itso we see a welcome tab over here we canclose this welcome Tab and explore whatall is there in the vs code tab as ofnow there's no project here so it looksvery empty but we'll create a flutterproject open at nvs code and that willlook much better but as of now let'sjust take a look at the blank and mtvscodeso the first tab that we have here isthe Explorer tab the Explorer tab helpsus to view the filesand the subfolders present in a folderso if we have a flutter project it willhave many folders and files of ourapplication we can see all of them overhere the second one is the search tab inthe search tab you can find a specificwordfrom multiple files and multiple foldersso if you want to search just one wordor just one function name you can typeit over here and it will outputall the files that contain that functionnamethen we have the source control tabremember git that we installed this isnot the tab we are going to look atbecause that's a separate world of itsownI'll be releasing a separate tutorial onSource control with get so you don'thave to worry about it for nowthe next one is run on debug this is aplace where you can run and debug yourapplications and the final tab we seehere is the extensions tabthe extensions tab allow us to addadditional features to our code editorso we'll be installing a bunch ofextensions so that our flutter codelooks better and we have an increasedproductivity in our coding but for nowI'm not going to install anything I'llinstall all of the extensions one by oneso that you see the differenceof using an extension and not using anextensionthen here we have the errors andwarnings tab so it tells us what errorsand warnings there are and when youclick on it it opens a separate windowof its own here we see problems so itwill output any problems that arepresent in our App application so it canbea warning or an errorso in dot pad you remember how we sawwarnings
