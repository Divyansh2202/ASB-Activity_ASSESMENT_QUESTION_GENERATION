that a variable was inducedor an error which said like when we hadprint statement and we put in two tothree arguments it said you cannot passtwo to three arguments to a printfunction all those kind of Errors can beseen from here in one particular placethen we have output so it will outputanything we want then we have debugconsole so whenever you run yourapplication all the print statements andeverything can be seen over herehow is output different from debugconsole then output will basically tellyou more about theproject as a whole for examplewhenever you add an external dependencyso remember in our DOT code we add butan HTTP dependencywhere whenever we add it to our Floridaproject it will showall the dependencies present in ourapplication in the output here and debugconsole basically tells us what ishappening when we are running theapplication then we have the terminal sothis is an inbuilt terminalthis terminal that we had right overherethat is an external terminal meaning itis coming from the system itself this iscoming from vs code so we can eliminateusing this terminal right here and wecan just start using integrated terminalall the time that makes sense and youcan add as many terminals as you want byclicking on the plus button over hereand delete whenever you want to deleteit then if you close the closed tab itwill just close this window right herethen you have the feedback option andthe notifications tab over here so youcan come back to Explorer now the nextstep is to create a flutter project andthe first project that we are going tocreate is a currency converterapplicationso to create a flutter project there areagain two steps you can take you canopen up your terminal from your or fromthe BS code terminal now to open vscodes integrated terminal you can presscommand J if you're on Mac and that willopen the terminal right over here okayand you can again press command J tohide it or you can just use the terminalover here both of them workNow to create a flutter project firstyou need to go to the folder where youwant to create a flutter project I wantto go to the desktop folder becausethat's where I want to create a flutterprojectand after that I'll run the commandflutter createand then the name of the project whichis currency converterso this will create a flood up projectby the name of currency converter andthen when I click on enterit creates a project please note thatwhen you have flutter create you need toput underscore over here in case youwant toput a space because if you just put aspace it won't be allowed it will giveyou an error you can try it for your ownand camel casing is generally not theconvention to name a flood a project itis generally named like this so if youhave a space you just use an underscorejust like the Instagram usernames now wecan just take this folder and drag itaway up and there we go we haveeverything related to our flutterproject hereand as you can see there are multiplefolders over here you can see that in vscode as well but there are a few thingsmore that you can see in vs code whichis dot dot toolwhich you cannot see it over here andDot idea which again you cannot see itover hereto see it you can just press commandshift full stop and you'll see all thehidden files over hereand again press command shift full stopso you'll stop seeing the hidden filesso vs code helps us see the hidden filesas well now let's go over the foldersone by one so dot tool and Dot idea isnothing that we should be concernedabout we should be concerned aboutfolders starting from here so we haveAndroid folder so it's related to allthe Android permissions that mightrequireso whenever you have an app that wantssome permission from Android relatedstuffyou'll use this folder and it basicallyhas the entire structure of an Androidapplication a native Android applicationright herethen we have the iOS folderthis has the structure similar to an iOSfolder whenever you want to give anyextra permission you'll have to openthis iOS folder in xcode and you cangive your permissions that are requiredthen we have the lip folder the mostimportant folder in our flutter projectthis is where you're going to write allyour Dart code and here we have just onefile which is the main dot dot file andas you can see this might look familiarvoid Mainfunction and this has a dot dotextension which basically means thatthis is a dart file and if this is a DOTfile we already know main function iswhere the application beginsso this is the starting point of our appandthe lib folder is where you're going toinstall or you know add more of yourfilesand build your entire application thenwe have the Linux Mac OS folder similarto the Android and iOS folder if youwant to give any permissions you'll givethem over here for Linux and Mac OS thenwe add the test folder test folder isrelated to the testing of our app bytesting I do not mean like a normal usertesting it you know when a user usestheir phone and uses the app that's notcalled testing I'm talking aboutautomated testingmeaning you just write a bunch of codeso that you confirm that this piece ofcode is workingit won't make sense now but after you'vebuilt a few applications you'llunderstand what I'm talking about thenwe have the web folder web foldercontains all the assets the index.htmlfile basically the entire web structurethen we have the windows as well then wehave get ignore which is related toSource control so whenever you have toupload to something known as GitHubyou'll need this get ignore files whichignores all the unnecessary files in ourproject then we have metadataand as you can see it already tells usthis file tracks properties of thisflutter project it's nothing we shouldbe concerned about so we can just skipthis part then we have analysis optionsdot yianl you remember the warnings anderrors we used to get we can configuresuch that we get more specific errors orwarnings in our Florida projectthen we have currency converter
