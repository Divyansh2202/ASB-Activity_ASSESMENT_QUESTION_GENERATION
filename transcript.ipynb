       "\"in this course we are going to learn tobuild apps for multiple platforms likeAndroid iOS web and desktop from asingle code base using the flutterframework this course is designed forabsolute beginners infiniter however Ihighly recommend you to watch the dartbeginners course present on the channelas this course requires a strongunderstanding of Dart this course solelyfocuses on flutter app development anddoes not cover any database relatedtopics we'll create three apps in thiscourse first one is a simple currencyconverter app to get started second isthe weather app where all the weatherdata is being fetched from the web andthe last one is a shopping appby building these three apps we learnvarious aspects of flutter such aswidgets layouts responsive layouts StateManagementEtcadditionally I'll provide you with abrief overview of the inner workings offlutter like understanding how flutterhandles rendering State Management andmore behind the scene stuff I've covereddatabase related topics in separatetutorials which you can easily followalong after watching this tutorialbefore starting this course I'd like tothank RF Islam for providing me with theUI of the shop app and Tomic reader andIsmail Alam Khan for helping me set upthe curriculum of this course now let'sget started by installing flutter so toinstall flutter you need to make sureyou're on this website flutter.dev thenyou can click on docs install flutterand then you'll see a bunch of optionsto select the operating system on whichyou want to install flutter so if youare on Windows or Linux you can clickeither of them and if you're on Mac youcan click on Mac OS now I won't be ableto cover the windows and Linuxinstallation processes because I don'thave either of those systemshowever there's one thing I'd like tomention that if you just click over hereyou'll get the entire installationprocess and most of it is similar to theinstallation process on Mac OS so weneed to get the flutter SDK we need todo the Android setup and if there'sanything we can do the Windows setup aswell but one thing you need to doadditional is install git if you haven'talready so for flutter you need to havegit pre-installed in your system so youcan click on open a new tab and downloadthe get installer from here depending onyour system you can either install this32-bit or this which is 64-bit after youhave the installer you can double clickon it and run it then follow all theprocesses the wizard gives you and thenyou'll have get installed in your systemto check if it is installed or not youcan go to your system and just type getif you see something like this it meansget us installedif it isn't then you haven't installedit properly you need to make sure thatit's installed properly all right solet's clear this off andone last thing to mention over here iswhen you have the Windows installationprocess you cannot do iOS setup becauseyou cannot build apps for iOS from aWindows machine you can only build appsfor Android web and windows from aWindows operating system you can buildfor Android web and Linux from a Linuxoperating system but you cannot buildfor iOS or Mac OS from Windows or Linuxso that's a point to know that's why ifyou see a wire you don't have IOS setupwritten over herehowever if you come to Windows or Mac OSinstallation you'll see iOS setup herewe have xcode which already includes getwhich means we don't have to install gitseparately on Mac all right you can seeit away flutter users get forinstallation and upgrade we recommendinstalling xcode which includes get butyou can also you install git separatelyall right so we are just going toinstall it with xcode I already have itinstalled it doesn't make any differencebut if you don't have git installedwe'll install it when we install xq sonow let's dive into this so the firstpart is to get the flutter SDKso to get the flutter SDK depending onwhat Mac you have Intel Mac or applesilicon Mac you can select either ofthese buttonssince I am on an M1 chip I'm just goingto click over here and it will start theinstallation process for me on Windowsalso the first part is to get theflutter SDK you'll get only one buttonto install the flutter SDK on Windowsafter that you need to extract the filein the desired locationso you need to make sure one particularfolder where you can install it for me Ialready know where I want to do it so ifI go to found finder press command shiftGthen just a forward slash so I go toMacintosh HDput it in a grid format so that it'sbetter to seewhere I want to install flutter is usersdriven ranavat and over here all rightso from the root of my laptop I want togo to users everyone ranavat and hereI'll have the flutterfolder or extract so once theinstallation is complete which I thinkis complete I'll drag it over here soI'll just open a new finder which hasdownloadsI'll have flutter over here I'll drag itover here in my advantra now with folderand there we have flutter right herecool now the next step is to add theflutter tool to our path now we can justcopy this Command put it in the terminaland run it and then we'll be able to useflutter specific commands like flutterdoctorbut now you can see flutter command isnot find because I've not run thiscommand and if I run this commandmeaning I add flutter tool to my paththen run it so it will locate flutterdoctor so it will know what fluttercommand is but when I exit the terminalreopen the terminal again it will forgetthe flutter command because it only setsthe path for the current terminal windowit doesn't set it for the entireterminal or for the entire systemit only does for one windowso to permanently add it we have toclick a wire which is permanentlyupdating a path and follow the stepswritten over hereso the first step is to determine thepath of our clone of the flutter SDKso we already know where it is from theroot of our folder we need to go to theusersflutter bin so this is our path allright then we need to open or create theRC file for your shell then we need totype this command in the terminal solet's go ahead and copy itso we have slash bin slash zshtyping this command gives us access towhat shell we are using IV using bash orare we using search shell since it givesus the output as zsh it means we areusing that shell so I need to edit thispart right here okay so I'll just copyit then over here I'm going to type Vimwhich is kind of like a code editor soif I just put themlike this I'll be able to edit out zshrcfile right here in the Vim code editor Ican also type Nanoinstead of Vim followed by dollar homeslash Dot zshrc and that will open it inNano but I'm more comfortable with whimso I'm going to go ahead and use itnow the final step is to copy this lineand paste it over here so here we needto mention the path of the flutter getdirectory where is it it's in usersso we canbackspace over here but when I try tobackspace you see I just go in the lefthand side it's not actually deletinganything so to delete it we have topress X so it will start erasing stuffthen you can backspace everything andpaste this line right here all right sowe have export path is equal todouble inverted comma dollar path colonslash user slash this is where we havestored right slash user slasher and runout slash flutterslash bin all right thenthat's pretty much it now we can pressenterthen we can have colon W click on enterthat saves the file then we'll havecolon queue a and we exert them likethisnow if we run the command again you'llsee we have this line written right overhere that's good so it has saved itsuccessfully and we have successfullyadded it to our path as well now we needto run this command so that we refreshthe current window to see our you knowchanges if flutter command is working ornot or we can just open a new terminalwindow so I'm just going to close thisI'm going to create a new terminal andthen I need to run this command toverify that the flutter pathflutter bin directory is now in our pathso we can run this and we see usersrewind out flutter bin that's great nowI can clear this off now I need toverify if the flutter command is workingor not so I'll copy this paste it overhere and there we gothis gives us the location of ourflutter folderthis is where it's located right usersflutter bin flutter right this thingright hereso we have successfully installedflutter to our system if you're onWindowsafter updating your path which ismentioned in the documentation youshould be able to run which fluttercommand and see the correct output ifyou do that means flutter installedsuccessfully now we can just run theflutter doctor command which gives us alist of things now that we need to focuson and flutterdoctor gives me a list ofthings so it's kind of like a realdoctor it tells you what all is notthere what all is missing and this iswhat you need to do so Shredder isinstalled we are on 3.10.5 which is thelatest version as of June 21. now thenext step is to install Android relatedstuff you can see that over here androidsetupthen we need to work on xcode so wedevelop for iOS and Mac OSand after that you know we are basicallydone with everything Android Studio isrelated to Android related stuff sowe'll have all of those working so let'sget to the Android setup not wasting anymore time and just start installingAndroid Studio as wellso Android Studio is helping us to buildnative Android applications so you canuse Scotlandor Javaand start preparing your apps in AndroidStudio as well so we need to installthis as well so we'll just open it in anew taband we'll click on download AndroidStudio we have read the terms andconditions and we have the Apple chip sowe'll select that now we'll wait forAndroid Studio to install properly andafter that we need to start AndroidStudio go through the Android setupwizardthis will install the latest Android SDKAndroid SDK command line tools andAndroid SDK build tools which arerequired by flutter When developing forAndroidso after we do all of that we again runflutterdoctor and we see if there's atick mark over here because we'veinstalled Android Studio so AndroidStudio is installed successfully let'sdouble click on this TMG file let'stransfer it to Applicationsand Android Studio is transferred toapplications now we can also put thisinstaller in bin if you want you canalso go ahead and put this in bin whichis another installerthen we can go to Applicationslet's go to Android Studio double clickover herethen it asks us if it is downloaded frominternet and if we trust it so you justclick on open againwe are not going to import any AndroidStudio settings so we'll just click onOKmaybe we can send usage statistics toGoogle we can click on nextchoose the type of setup you want forAndroid so we have not installedanything earlier so we'll just go aheadwith the standard onewe'll click on nextselect the UI theme you want let's goahead with doculathen these are the extra things thatwill install emulator build tools all ofthat stuff we'll click on nextthen live sensors for everything we'llclick on acceptwe'll come over hereexcept for this one as well then we'llclick on finish it will startdownloading the components for this soall the components have now beeninstalled we can click on finish and wehave Android studio right herewe don't want to do anything with thatwe are just going to close it we'llclose this as well now let's again runflutter doctor and see if there'sanything we're missing now as you cansee over here Android Studio is alreadyinstalled now so that was successful NowAndroid related stuff two things arerequired we need the command line toolscomponent so for that we are again goingto run Android Studiothen we are going to go to more actionsSDK managerthen we are going to search for SDKtoolsthen we have Android SDK command linetools right here we'll click over thereand then click on OK click on okay overhere that will install it and we aredoneso we can close this let's again runflutterdoctor commandand you see that issue is resolved nowwe now only need to accept the Androidlicenses that we haven't so we can runthis command and it will do that we justneed to put it in the same line and runit and then it works all right soyeah we'll review the licenses that havenot been accepted then we'll click yesyes yes yesand there we go so we have been acceptedall the licenses so I hope everything isworking fine for Android now so we'llrun flutter doctor and everythingrelated to Android is also fixed now nowthe last step is xcode developed for iOSand Mac OSso the final step that's required is forxcode so we need to develop for iOS andMac OS we can do that by going to theApp Store and installing xcode or justgo into the web download I'll go to theApp Store and install itso I'll wait for xcode to install andthen we can focus on the stuff that'smentioned later on so I'll see you whenxcode is installed completely on thesystem all right so xcode has installedon our system I'll just click on openhere so we like to build for Mac OS andiOS so I'm just going to click oninstall here I'll have to enter mypassword and then it will startinstalling additional components afterthat we need to configure the xcodecommand lines tools to use the newlyinstalled version of xcode so we canjust copy this linethen click on enter again we'll have toenter a password over here and we aredone then we can again run this commandpaste itso this is great I think we'veconfigured xcode for nowone last command is left which is thispseudo xcode build licensewe'llpress space for moreand then we just need to type agree tosay that we are agreeing and we are donenow we can clear this off run flutterdoctor and see if it is done properly ornotso one issue from xcode is gone now wejust need to install cocoapod which isnot installed so to install it we canjust go to their guide the link that ismentioned over herepaste itand to install Coco pod we just need torun this command sudogem installcocoapodsso we have installed cocoapods now wecan again run the flutterdoctor commandand as you can see no issues found thatmeans the entire flutter installation issuccessful so if you've covered thispart and everything works fine it's allgood now the last stepis to install vs codeso if you just type in vs code installyou'll see this websitecode.visualstudio.com so this isbasically our code editor this is wherewe are going to write our code type itall out in the dart course we had useddotpad.dev now we don't need to use thatanymorewe're going to write on our system onlyso we are going to use our PCand here we have Visual Studio code thatwill help us to you knowdebug writer code it will help us andbasically everythingso you can install it according to yourplatform again I'm just going to goahead with the Apple silicon zip fileand it will start installing it for meafter I have vs code installed I'll juststart creating a flutter project andwe'll create a first app that is thecurrency converter app so vs code is nowinstalled you can see it and downloadsI'm just going to click on the smallsearch icon over hereso it shows that Visual Studio code isin the download I'm just going to dragthis to the applications tab because vscode is an application then double clickon itthen click on openand we have vs code right here I'm goingto browse the color themes and selectwhich one I prefer I don't prefer thedark high contrast it looks very weirdin my opinionobviously notlight modern color we can use this oneor you can go ahead look for more themesso now that we have Visual Studio codeinstalled let's go ahead and open it soI'll have Visual Studio code Type likethis and open itso we see a welcome tab over here we canclose this welcome Tab and explore whatall is there in the vs code tab as ofnow there's no project here so it looksvery empty but we'll create a flutterproject open at nvs code and that willlook much better but as of now let'sjust take a look at the blank and mtvscodeso the first tab that we have here isthe Explorer tab the Explorer tab helpsus to view the filesand the subfolders present in a folderso if we have a flutter project it willhave many folders and files of ourapplication we can see all of them overhere the second one is the search tab inthe search tab you can find a specificwordfrom multiple files and multiple foldersso if you want to search just one wordor just one function name you can typeit over here and it will outputall the files that contain that functionnamethen we have the source control tabremember git that we installed this isnot the tab we are going to look atbecause that's a separate world of itsownI'll be releasing a separate tutorial onSource control with get so you don'thave to worry about it for nowthe next one is run on debug this is aplace where you can run and debug yourapplications and the final tab we seehere is the extensions tabthe extensions tab allow us to addadditional features to our code editorso we'll be installing a bunch ofextensions so that our flutter codelooks better and we have an increasedproductivity in our coding but for nowI'm not going to install anything I'llinstall all of the extensions one by oneso that you see the differenceof using an extension and not using anextensionthen here we have the errors andwarnings tab so it tells us what errorsand warnings there are and when youclick on it it opens a separate windowof its own here we see problems so itwill output any problems that arepresent in our App application so it canbea warning or an errorso in dot pad you remember how we sawwarnings that a variable was inducedor an error which said like when we hadprint statement and we put in two tothree arguments it said you cannot passtwo to three arguments to a printfunction all those kind of Errors can beseen from here in one particular placethen we have output so it will outputanything we want then we have debugconsole so whenever you run yourapplication all the print statements andeverything can be seen over herehow is output different from debugconsole then output will basically tellyou more about theproject as a whole for examplewhenever you add an external dependencyso remember in our DOT code we add butan HTTP dependencywhere whenever we add it to our Floridaproject it will showall the dependencies present in ourapplication in the output here and debugconsole basically tells us what ishappening when we are running theapplication then we have the terminal sothis is an inbuilt terminalthis terminal that we had right overherethat is an external terminal meaning itis coming from the system itself this iscoming from vs code so we can eliminateusing this terminal right here and wecan just start using integrated terminalall the time that makes sense and youcan add as many terminals as you want byclicking on the plus button over hereand delete whenever you want to deleteit then if you close the closed tab itwill just close this window right herethen you have the feedback option andthe notifications tab over here so youcan come back to Explorer now the nextstep is to create a flutter project andthe first project that we are going tocreate is a currency converterapplicationso to create a flutter project there areagain two steps you can take you canopen up your terminal from your or fromthe BS code terminal now to open vscodes integrated terminal you can presscommand J if you're on Mac and that willopen the terminal right over here okayand you can again press command J tohide it or you can just use the terminalover here both of them workNow to create a flutter project firstyou need to go to the folder where youwant to create a flutter project I wantto go to the desktop folder becausethat's where I want to create a flutterprojectand after that I'll run the commandflutter createand then the name of the project whichis currency converterso this will create a flood up projectby the name of currency converter andthen when I click on enterit creates a project please note thatwhen you have flutter create you need toput underscore over here in case youwant toput a space because if you just put aspace it won't be allowed it will giveyou an error you can try it for your ownand camel casing is generally not theconvention to name a flood a project itis generally named like this so if youhave a space you just use an underscorejust like the Instagram usernames now wecan just take this folder and drag itaway up and there we go we haveeverything related to our flutterproject hereand as you can see there are multiplefolders over here you can see that in vscode as well but there are a few thingsmore that you can see in vs code whichis dot dot toolwhich you cannot see it over here andDot idea which again you cannot see itover hereto see it you can just press commandshift full stop and you'll see all thehidden files over hereand again press command shift full stopso you'll stop seeing the hidden filesso vs code helps us see the hidden filesas well now let's go over the foldersone by one so dot tool and Dot idea isnothing that we should be concernedabout we should be concerned aboutfolders starting from here so we haveAndroid folder so it's related to allthe Android permissions that mightrequireso whenever you have an app that wantssome permission from Android relatedstuffyou'll use this folder and it basicallyhas the entire structure of an Androidapplication a native Android applicationright herethen we have the iOS folderthis has the structure similar to an iOSfolder whenever you want to give anyextra permission you'll have to openthis iOS folder in xcode and you cangive your permissions that are requiredthen we have the lip folder the mostimportant folder in our flutter projectthis is where you're going to write allyour Dart code and here we have just onefile which is the main dot dot file andas you can see this might look familiarvoid Mainfunction and this has a dot dotextension which basically means thatthis is a dart file and if this is a DOTfile we already know main function iswhere the application beginsso this is the starting point of our appandthe lib folder is where you're going toinstall or you know add more of yourfilesand build your entire application thenwe have the Linux Mac OS folder similarto the Android and iOS folder if youwant to give any permissions you'll givethem over here for Linux and Mac OS thenwe add the test folder test folder isrelated to the testing of our app bytesting I do not mean like a normal usertesting it you know when a user usestheir phone and uses the app that's notcalled testing I'm talking aboutautomated testingmeaning you just write a bunch of codeso that you confirm that this piece ofcode is workingit won't make sense now but after you'vebuilt a few applications you'llunderstand what I'm talking about thenwe have the web folder web foldercontains all the assets the index.htmlfile basically the entire web structurethen we have the windows as well then wehave get ignore which is related toSource control so whenever you have toupload to something known as GitHubyou'll need this get ignore files whichignores all the unnecessary files in ourproject then we have metadataand as you can see it already tells usthis file tracks properties of thisflutter project it's nothing we shouldbe concerned about so we can just skipthis part then we have analysis optionsdot yianl you remember the warnings anderrors we used to get we can configuresuch that we get more specific errors orwarnings in our Florida projectthen we have currency converter dot IMLnothing we should be concerned aboutthen we have pubspec.log andpubspec.yamlso pubspect.yaml consists ofall the details of our flutter projectfor example the name of the project thedescription of the project then thisline which is related to pub.dev youremember the site where we went toinstall HTTP plugin so if we create ourown dot project and we want to publishit to pub.devthen we need to remove this line if weare only building a flutter appand that is not to be published onpub.dev we can keep this linethat we have the version number of ourFlorida project or the flutter appso if you have ever noticed everyapplication has a version attached to itso if you just click on an app and go toits app info you'll see the version forit for example the WhatsApp version asof now is 2.23.11.77that's what this version number allowsus to do it allows us to upload to AppStore Play Store and all the otherstores without creating the confusionthat two projects are similar or thesame so you can have unique versionsevery time you upload to app store orPlay Store then we have environment sothis tells us the flutter SDK we'll beusing in this project andthe hdk we are using is basicallygreater than or equal to 3.0.5 but lessthan 4.0.0 so you can use anything fromflutter 3 to flutter 4 over here and itwill obey all the rules you can alsodecrease your SDK so you can just puttwo over hereand it can be less than three so it willfollow all the rules related to flutter2 to flutter 3. but obviously you needto make sure that you have fluttered twoinstalled for that but it's always goodto stay on the latest SDK not on theprevious SDK because you need to keep upwith the advancements in your frameworkright if we have flutterwe always need to make sure that we areupdated to it so that we can use all itslatest featuresthen we add the dependencies tab and inthe dependency the first one we have isflutter which is coming from the flutterSDK itselfand we have the Cupertino icons theCupertino icons dependency can be foundon pub.devbut it basically allows us to use iOSstyled icons Cupertinoeverywhere in our flutter code is goingto relate to the iOS part so if you haveCupertino icons we have IOS style iconsthen we have Dev dependencies we alreadyknow what dependencies arewe have already installed a dependencynot DOT pad which was the HTTP Plugin orthe HTTP packagein-depth dependencies we havedependencies related to the developer soif developer needs anything that willhelpthe developer to you know write code andincrease productivity they can use thatbut it doesn't affect the user Behaviorat all okay so whatever you have overhere is just related to the developerhaving a better environment and here wehave the flutter lenspackage and the federal lens package isconnected to the analysis option.yamlwhich is our linter you can see includepackage flutter lens flutter.amlI know this might not make sense but weare just starting right now as we moveahead you'll understand what I'm talkingaboutthen we have flutter which says usersmaterial design to true then you havesomething related to assets we'll getinto it then we have something relatedto fonts as well we'll get into itand that's pretty much all aboutpubspec.yamlforeigncontains all the packages that we mighthave installedand keeps the track of the versionnumber the description from where itcame everythingand at last we have the readme.md so ifyou want anyone to read yourproject and you know you have certainguidelines to follow you can have areadme aware which tells everythingabout it and if you click on this iconall of this text away or translate tothis this is what dot MD represents MDis short for markdown so whenever youhave hashtag like this it thinks this isan H1 kind of title a bigger title thenyou have a normal text then you havetwo hashtags which is a smallerheaderthen you have smaller text then you havelinks and all of that stuffso this basically allowsany other engineer working on yourproject to read more about it and youknow understand how to contribute andall of that stuffso we can close this and we have two theentire flutter project now let's go tothe main.dot file which is where we aregoing to be 90 of the times not in themain.file but in the lip folder ingeneral we can create more dot files wecan do more things and 95 percent of thetimes you're just going to stay in theslip folder and not move out of itbecause this is where the entire flutterproject is cookedso yeah this is where we are main.dotfile now what I want to do is there's abunch of code written here by default Ijust want to run it but even beforerunning there are a few things I want todo for example you might not be able tosee this font so I just want to increasethe font size over here to increase it Iam going to press command shift psettingsthen click on open settingsclick on text editor over hereclick on font and here I can increase myfont size so my font size can be let'ssay 20click on enter come over here and itzoomed in a little bit too much so Ithink I'm going to go ahead with 18this is better but what about 17. Ithink 18 works well for me and I hopeyou're also able to see this I'm alsogoing to put this panel like this sothat my code gets more spaceand that looks cool now another problemthat I have here is the highlightingpart by highlighting I meanI just don't want my code Editor to lookblue whiteand just orange you know I want morecolors to be present if you look at takea look at dot pad you'll see extensionwhich of the keyword is in greenextension name is an orange color on isagain a keyword so green a data type soit's in white color again a data typeswhite color function or a variable nameis in blue color so I want a similarkind of highlighting to be present sothat it's easy for me to distinguishbetween dot stuff and a lot of stuff allrightso for that I can again press commandshift ptype preferences and I'll find somethinglike color theme over here I just needto click it and change the theme overhere so if I change the team to darkPlusyou see there is a colored change overherenow it's not no longer just white andblue it has multiple colors over hereblue is a keyword a class name has greencoloragain this is a keyword widgetis a class built as a function so it hasall of the properhighlighting that I wantednow the next step is to run the defaultcode that is provided by flutter andjust take a look at how flutter lookswhen it just creates a project for usand we do absolutely nothingso for this how can we run well we canjust go to the Run tab run withoutdebugging and it tells us that we don'thave an extension for debugging dotshould we find a DOT extension in themarketplace you can click over here butI'm just going to click on a cancelbecause I know what to doit's not the DOT extension that we arelooking for we are looking for somethingrelated to fluttervs code tells that because we are in adart file it doesn't know that we arerunning a flutter related project so wedon't need to find a extension specificto dot we need to find an extensionspecific to flutterso we'll go to the extensions tab overhere type flutter click on enterand it gives us the extension flutterwhich is provided by the dot team or theGoogle team itself we can just click oninstall awareand what this will do is basicallyprovide us with a set of tools whichwill allow us to edit refactor run anddebug our applicationsand when we install the flutterextension another extension that we getby default is the dart extension becauseflutter included Dotso it only makes sense to include thedart extension as wellnow we can come over here close thisextension go to the main.dot file andyou see we have a new bulb icon showingup here then we have run debug profilethree buttons right hereon the right hand side we have devicesshowing up where we can select from MacOS Chrome IO simulator or pixel emulatorwhich is the Android emulatorsince we installed xcode we got accessto iOS simulator since we installedAndroid Studio it defaultcreatedthe pixel emulator if you don't seepixel emulator over here you can just goahead and create your own Androidemulator all right and if you see anerror like this what you need to do isjust go to Android studio right hereclick on more actions virtual devicemanagerand click on create a device select thephone that you want from your let's saypixel 4 XLor let's go ahead with pixel 6 then weclick on next we'll use the API 34 thedefault one if you want to change theAPI so let's say you want to useAndroid or Android s whatever you canuse that I'm going to go ahead with theAPI 34.click on next then we have pixel 6 API34all the default optionsif you want you can change the Androidadvance settings as well where you canchange the ramthe virtual memory Heap the internalstorage so we can change the internalstorage to GB and let's say550 GBwhatever you want I'm just kidding youknow just have 20 GB like this thenclick on finish and that creates anemulator for you if you want to run ityou can just click on thislaunch icon or you can just come overhere and you'll see the pixel 6 API 34emulator scene over hereand if you want to default remove thedefault pixel emulator that it createdfor you you can go ahead and click onthese three options delete and it willdelete it for youso let's delete it we only want to keepjust one emulator over here and if weagain go to the devices the device is nolonger there there's just pixel 6 API34.so let's go ahead and run theproject so where do we want to run itwell we want to run it on let's sayChromeso we'll select the Chrome device overherethen we'll click on run and it willstart running it for youyou see there are a bunch of things thathappened here it opened the debugconsole so it is launching lib slashmain.dot on Chrome and debug mode sothis tells us a thing about flutter andDot by default it goes to the lib slashmain dot dot file to run the project sothis is the first file to get executedin after projectthen we have this settings thing righthere it gives us a bunch of settingsover here for example if you want topause the debugging if you want torestart your application if you want tohot reload your application if you wantto stop it so if you stop it this thingright here will get executedexited so if you close thisyou see the web application is now goneso again let's click on run and it willstart running it for you and we alsohave this search icon which is widgetinspector page so if you click over hereit doesn't start anything right now butagain if you click over here it willopen the widget inspector widgetinspector is a kind of thing that allowsyou to see how your application isstructured but we'll get to it later onbecause you don't know what widgets areright so let's close thisand there we go we have a floss flutterapp right here we have this good lookingapp and this increment button if I clickover here it just increases this thingright here so it's a very basic apprunning on web if you want to run moreapps you can do it simultaneously so youcan open it and run it on Mac OS soclick on run your run without debuggingwhich is another way to run your flutterapps you can either do it over here youcan either do it over here or you canjust run the command flutter Run Okay sothat works as wellso let's just click on run over here aswell which opens it on Mac OS so we haveour application running on Chrome andMac OS bothwe can also run three apps in one placeso we'll start the iOS simulator firstbecauseit's not running in the background likeMac OS and chrome so we'll first have tostart the simulator and here we haveiPhone 14 pro Maxwhich is given to us by xcode so it'sloading right now we can also start ourpixel emulator so we'll just click onthisstart icon right here and thatwill launch as well and as you can seethe Mac OS part is running hereif I just expand thisis our Mac OS app and this is our webapp both of them look very similar rightalmost the samethat is because of flutteryou can run one code base so you havea consistent looking UI design on bothyourMac OS app and your Windows app and itworks the same way okay nothing isdifferent right here now we also haveour pixel emulator and iPhone radio sowe can run those as well and they'llworkside by side as well just make sure youhave the current device selected overhere so that you launch it over there ifI want to run it on iPhone I'll justclick on run run without debugging withiPhone selected aware if I want to runpixel I'll select pixel over here andrun it so whatever you select over hereand when you click over and run overherethat device will be run I hope that wasclear and if you click over here thereare four devices we are connected to andrunning at the same time if you presscommand J it opens the terminal you cango to the debug consoleyou have Macos over hereChrome right over herepixel 6 loading and iPhone loading aswellnow I don't like running all of theplatforms at the same time becausewe can lose out on a lot of battery veryquickly because we are running on fourplatforms togetherwhat I like to do is run on twoplatforms at the most so it can beiPhoneAndroid iPhone web depending on where Iwant to launch itso if I want to build an app only forAndroid and iOS it makes sense to onlyuse Android and iOS at the same time orif you're sure that it will have aconsistent UI design on both Android andiOS there will be no changesyou can just run it on one device if youwant to launch your app on all thedevicesor on all the platforms then you canjust have maybe a web platform and aniOS simulator runningso it really depends on you if you wantyour battery to get exhausted veryquicklyyou can go ahead and run on all the fourplatforms there's no problem with itso our iPhone process is almost done youcan see xcode well doneand it uses the impeller run renderingbackend we'll get into what impeller isbut if we just come over here here isour iPhone application and when we clickover here we are able to see the samething that we saw over here and here sowe are able to run our app on all theplatforms let's get done with theAndroid one as well it is installing abunch of things once it completesinstalling it will start running theapplication and thenwe can start designing our currencyconverter app from scratch and whileAndroid is being run let's take a lookat a few more things I want to get intofirst one is the file explorer tab overhere it looks very plain doesn't itwhat I want here is certain symbols tobe present so that I can distinguishbetween an iOS folder or a lib folderreally quickly so for that we have anextension which is called vs code iconsthere are a bunch of vs code extensionsrelated to file iconsbut my favorite one is vs code iconswhich you can click on install and itwill bring icons to your file explorerand here you see after you install it itsaid it asks you to select a file icontheme vs code icons or city which isprovided by Visual Studio code itself Iwant vs code icons because that's betterfor meI'll come over here and you see all ofmy folders now have a unique icon to itso we have Android which gives ussomething similar to Android build iOSso we have Apple logoLinux Mac OS testweb windows so everything has adifferent icon to it so I candistinguish between all of them reallyquickly and it just helps me overallalso I can see that the pixel emulatoris now workingso I can just come over here and therewe go we have our app showing here aswell so it looks similar on all theplatforms That's The Power of usingflutter so now what I'm going to do isexit from almost all the platforms justkeep one platform on the side so that Ihave a perspective of what's going on soI'll close Chrome I'll close Mac OS I'llclose pixel as wellI'll just keep the iPhone on the siderest all the things are now goneI can also close the Android emulator ifI want so I'll just select this click oncommand Qit will save the state and close thepixel emulator for us awesome now wejust have the is simulator here and nowwe can start preparing our currencyconverter app so this is where we aregoing to start writing real flutter andDot code so to begin our work on thecurrency converter app what I'm going todo is press command a so that I selecteverything present in the main.dot filethen I'm going to backspace everythingand we'll start writing everything fromscratch yes we are going to need a lotof components that are already mentionedover here these are sort of boilerplatecode meaning if you don't have them yourflutter app won't work properlyso you need to have them but we'll startwriting everything from scratch so thatwe understand why we need them in thefirst place for example the statelesswidget thing this material app thing allof those things right so let's backspaceitthen like every DART program we need tocreate a main function because that'sour entry point to the DART programso what happens is flutter just searchesfor main.dot file in lib folder when itgets main.dart it searches for the mainfunction in the main.dot file and thenyou can see we get these three optionsto run our app so now we have a simpledot program with us what we need to dois tell flutter to come into action andstart running the app so how can we dothat to do that we have a simplefunction given by the flutter SDK itselfwhich is run up because we want to runthe app rightso we'll pass and run up over here whichis a function coming from some importline like this so as soon as we had runapp over here it automatically importedthis line right here now what is thisline well let's break this down we haveimport so it's importing some packagesome file someother project some other folder and thatis the flutter packageand in Florida package it's thematerial.dot now you might say hey thisline seems very similar to what we hadin the dart section we had importpackage HTTPhttp.dot this was the case because wewere importinghttp.dot file from HTTP package we aredoing the same thing over here but withflutter we are importing thematerial.dot file from the flutterpackage if you're curious how we areimporting package flutterif you just go to the pubspect.aml filedependencies this is where all thedependencies come inso anything extra your app depends onthat is not related to Dot comes in overhere so we have the flutter dependencyover here and this is coming from SDKphiladelunlike Cupertino underscore icons thatis coming from pop.devunlike the HTTP package that was comingfrom pub.dev this flutter is coming fromthe SDK flutterand what is this SDK flutter well it'sthe same thing that you installed onyour system locally and it's good tomention SDK flutter like this and notgive any path to it because the path ofthe flutter can changemaybe you reinstall it somewhere else sojust having SDK flutter like this is abetter thing so we can closepubspect.aml file and when we again comeover here we can see package flutter isimported and from there we are importingthe material.dart file why material.dotfile because material.dot file gives usmany of flutters functions classesmethods that we can use for example therun app file or the run app functionbecause in Dart we don't have anythinglike run appin Dart we have already seen we havestuff like string and all of thatstuff like stringinteger Boolean async keyword all ofthis can be used without importing theflutter library or the flutter packagebut stuff like run app cannot be runwithout importing flutter all rightand to import flutter you need to haveflutter installed and you need to makesure that in perspect.aml file you havethe dependency present so again comingback to run app so this import lineright here is quite important and you'llsee later on how many times thismaterial.dot is used in your flutter appit's almost used in every single fileyou create because it also gives youaccess to certain widgetsor certain UI things which is quitehelpful so now coming back to the runapp function what exactly is this run upfunction if you just hover over thisyou'll see the definition of thisfunction it is void run appand then it requires a parameter ofwidget appso that means an app is not returninganything and it requires something knownas widget app and since we don't knowwhat widget is that is not even a DOTrelated thing so that means widget isagain something created by flutter teamthemselves it's a thing in flutter so itmight be a custom class that theycreated but we are still not sure so tounderstand this what you can do is presscommandso you can click on run app thenand when you click over here you getdiveinto the flutter source code as you cansee over here users Advance are not slotup so I'm going into the flutter SDKthat I installed locally on my system totake a look at this definition andunderstand what this widget thing isand as you can see when I go in thedefinition when I hover over widget itsays that it's an abstract class widgetand we already know what abstractclasses areagain if you want to take a look at thedefinition of widget you can presscommand again and then click on widgetand you'll dive into the source code ofabstract class widgetbut we are not diving into the fluttersource code nowI just wanted to show this to you let'snot make things complicatedso now this requires something known asa widget what is this widgetwidgets are the building blocks of theuser interface they are responsible fordescribing what the UI should look likeso let's take an example of the counterapp over here if I want to describe thathey in my app I want the header likethisa pink or purple kind of background withsome text on it then I want some textsover here then I want a button over hereand on that button I want this plus typeof icon to be displayed so all of thesethings are widgets because they describewhat my screen what my user interface isgoing to look likeso that's exactly what we want to passto run appand this widget can be literallyany UI component right so I can just putin a text which is again provided byflutter material.dot and you have toinstantiate that text text again is aclass if you press command and go to thetext definition you'll see it is a classtext all right and also one thing that Ididn't mention please don't changeanything over hereif you change anything in the fluttersource code it will behave differentlyfor you over here and that can cause alot of problemsso take this as a read-only file if youjust want to take a look at what's goingon inside and you're just curious ingeneralbut do not edit it anything at allbecause if it stopsbehaving the way you want it to you'llhave to reinstall everything and thatcan be quite a headache unnecessarilyso you can close this nowso now we have the text over here andthat is a widgetso this text requires us to pass in adata as you can see whenever weinstantiate a classit tells us what all stuff is requiredin this textand the thing that's required over hereis string data and that is a positionalargument that's why we are getting theerror over here saying one positionalargument expected by text Dot Nu butzero foundwe've already seen these kind of errorsin the dot sectionso let's pass a string over hereand let's call my text hello world sothis string right here is what the textshould display right if we have atexture you have pushed this button thismany times that is a text right ifthat's a text the string data part isthis thing right here so that's whatI've typed in over here hello worldthen I'll put a semicolon over here saveit I'll ignore the warning for now alsoanything in blue underline is a warninganything with a red underline is awarning or is an error also anythingwith blue underline is a warning andanything with red underline is an erroryou can ignore warnings although youshouldn'tbut you cannot ignore errors because ifthere's an error your flutter app won'tbuild if there's a warning your flutterapp can still build but it's recommendedto fix the warnings before moving on andnow when we save it you see this thingright over herewe get a pop-up saying hot reloadcompleted what is this hot reload thinghot reload is when you have a small UItweak or some small change made in yourcode and then when you save the fileyou don't have to restart your entiresystem over here to see those changesin hot reload you can just save yourfile and it will display the small UItweaks present in your codeso you don't have to completely restartyour app and start everything fromscratch you can just save itand you'll be able to see the small UItweak if there is no small UI tweakthen you'll have to restart your app howdo we restart the app by clicking overhereon the city start button and as you cansee when we restart we getsome different kind of message over herewith red background this is an error allrightthe red warnings or the red underlinesdisplayed over here were compile timeerrors we've already known about that inthe dot sectionbut this ones are runtime errorsand you can also see runtime errors orcompile timeerrors when you press command Jin the debug console and you see they'vementioned the problem over herenowthese error messages also contain thestack Trace in the terminal over hereyou don't see the stack Trace what isstack Trace stack Trace basically allowsus to know where in our application theerror occurred because if ourapplication grows vast it can be a bitdifficult to know hey this is where theerror occurred right so stack Tracealready tells us hey you have a runtimeerror and this is where data code sothat's what text helps me withand as you can see the error is therelevant error causing widget was textokay so some error occurred related totext wireand then you have the exception Thronethis was the stack and this just goesdeep into the framework telling you heythis file this file this file this fileis where the error occurred but we don'thave to care that much about these linesbecause it's related to the frameworkand we'll anyways not be able tounderstand what's going onso we can just scroll up and you see thefollowing assertion was thrown buildingtext hello world so it's related to thisthing onlybut to be honest I don't understandanything that's mentioned over here butI do understand this thing nodirectionality widget found what doesthis directionality widget found meanit is at least legible English you knowbut still it's quite difficult tounderstand what's directionality widgetwith respect to this text widget wellthe point over here is this textrequires you to pass ina direction property we need to specifythe direction property over here becausewe need to specify the text position onthe screendo we want the text from to go from leftto right or do we want the text to gofrom right to left that's what we wantto figure out where on the screen shouldit be over here or over herethat's why it was giving us this errorso let's understand how we can fix thatand many a times you can fix the problemby looking at the properties of theparticular widget or the particular textclass and see if there is a propertyrelated to direction to fix itand the property is text direction rightand as you can see this is a namedargumentthe first thing was a positionalargument and after that we had namedarguments that were optionalso we can pass text Directionover here now you might ask if textdirection is necessary without textDirection it is giving us this errorwhy don't they make text Directionproperty non-optional as well just likedata rightif text direction is required in ourtext property without it it is giving usan error why do we want X direction tobe empty or nullable or optional thereason for that is most of the times youwon't be writing text widget like thisover here you'll be using somethingknown as material app that we are goingto look into in just a momentin just a while butthere direction for text is alreadydefined so you don't have to Define itover thereso it is optional but as of now just forme demoing basic flood or app to youit's requiredso for now you can blindly just put textDirection it will make much more sensewhen we have so as of now you can justput text Direction like thisblindly but later on you'll understandwhat I'm talking aboutwhen we start using material app andthose kind of stuffso we have X Direction over hereand this text Direction requires textDirection now is text Direction a classto understand that we have to presscommand and then we can go into the textDirection source code but it tellsnothing about text Directionwhy because this is the Constructor wehave to go to the place where textdirection is initialized sowe can click over text Direction andhere we are final text Direction whichis empty text Direction now tounderstand if text direction is a classor not we hover over thisand it tells us it's not a class it's anenumso text Direction can have a certainlimit of values now what are thosevalues you can again click command soyou go to the text Directionenum definition and here it isand it can have two values RTL or LTRand as you can see it's already definedover here with something known as adocumentation comment this was the thirdtype of commentin flutter we or Dotin flutter or dot in the dot course wesaw that there are two types of commentsfirst one wassingle line comment another one wasmulti-line comment and this is a thirdtype of comment which is thedocumentation comment by documentationcomment what happens is whenever Iinitialize text direction or use textDirection and hover over it you'll see adefinitionor the description of this textDirection propertyand somewhere when you scroll you'll seethis thing right here the text flowsfrom right to left example Arabic Hebrewyou won't see that over here becausethis is present inside the enum but ifyou see documentation comments arepresent over here as well which isrelated to the text Direction so if wejust go at the topyou'll see a direction in which textflows some languages are written fromthe left to right so if you come overhere hover over this you'll see adirection in which text flows sobasically with documentation commentsyou'll be able to see some changes overheresome stuff or description written overhere which is quite nice because thenyou don't have to Google stuff up andunderstand what's required you can justlook at the source code and understandwhat's requiredso let's close this let's close this andlet's give text Direction upvalue and that will be text DirectionDot and we get Auto suggestion the autosuggestion is LTR or R2Land values is just a list or containingRTL or LTR so I'm just going to have LTRbecause I wanted to show up over hereleft to right so it will show upsomewhere over here then I'll save itbut if I come away a hot reload doesn'twork because this is quite a massivechangeso you'll have to restart your entireapp and then you'll be able to see HelloWorld over here we are not able to seeit properly but yeah it is written overtherenow if I just mention let's say fourexclamation marks save it I'm not seeingit again because this is a massivechangeso after I restart I'll be able to seeitbut later on when we start addingmaterial app and we make small UI tweaksyou'll be able to see the great power ofhot reload which is what makes fluttervery different from other Frameworksbecause many other Frameworks don't havethe support for hot reload and it'squite a wonderful feature in my opinionand now if I press RTL over here insteadof LTR and restart the app I see textover here and my exclamation marks goright in the right so that was abouttext and you know just displaying somestuff up but now let's get intomore complex things because obviously wedon't just want to return a text overhere andfor bigger apps this is not possible whybecause simple apps don't just show UIright they have many more things goingon in the back end it's not aboutdatabases of servers that I'm talkingaboutnot the back end related stuff I'mtalking about stuff likenavigation by navigation I mean movingfrom one page to another so if I haveone page then I want to move to anotherpagebigger apps can do that for exampleYouTube if I use youtube.com I see thehome page when I click on a video I'llgo to another page that contains thevideo player so bigger apps havemultiple pages in them and moving fromone page to another in an app is callednavigation just like moving from oneplace to another in real life is knownas navigating right so bigger apps havesupport for that and it can't be done byjust using text we need to use somethingelse which is known as material app orit can be Cupertino app now we are goingto dive into both of them but beforethat we'll have to understand some otherConcepts now you knowjust having a text widget isn't what areal app like real app will look like itwill have one screen of its own and inthat screen there are going to be manycomponents as well for example if youjust open google.com it's a very simplelooking page but it has a lot ofcomponents here first of all it has theheader right up at the top Gmail imagesall of this stuff then it has the Googlelogo over here then it has the textfield that takes our input then it hastwo buttons then it has this thing whichhelps us in Translation then it hasfooter and that too two Footers I guessso it has a lot of components and influtter every component can be a widgetright so if you're coming from otherFrameworks like react you already knowwhat components are whatever UI buildingblock is there and in flutter widgetsare components my point is that this appwill grow into something big that willhave many components on the screen sowhat I want to do is make sure my app isbroken down into several smaller widgetsso that more Engineers can work on it atthe same time just imagine my entire apppresent in this function right here Ican do that it's totally possible so Ican build my entire app all the widgetslet's say the entire Google Chromescreen I can build in this function butdo you think that's feasible because itis it will become such a big thing rightit will have like hundreds and thousandsof lines of code all enclosed withinthis function so I obviously want tobreak it down so that more Engineers canwork your net togetherand when it's broken down you can allotdifferent files to it different classesto it and Engineers can work on net atthe same time and it will boostproductivity so that's what I want to doI want to segregatethis text widget in a widget of its ownthat won't have any UI change but itwill definitely have a productivityboost for our applicationso let's go ahead and create our owncustom widgetnot custom widget but our own widget andwe can do that by creating a classbecause widgets at the end of the dayare classes if you press command go tothe text definition you'll see text is aclass as well and it extends somethingknown as stateless widget to become awidgetso we need to do the same thingmy widget is going to be named as my appnothing too fancy therebecause if I name this as text then itwill be a problem rightbecause then it will get confused do youwant text from material.dot the thingthat is coming from flutter or do youwant to use your own text widget thatyou've created so better to just name itsomething else because there arehundreds of other names you can chooseso you can have mic appextending something known as statelesswidget now what is the stateless widgetstateless widget first of all is a typeof a widget and there are multiple typesof widgets by multiple I mean threefirst one isstateless widget which we have seenright now the second one is a state fullwidgetand the third one is inherited widgetso widgets can be broadly classified inthese three typesstateless widget and stateful widgetsare what we are going to discuss whilebuilding the first appwe need to thoroughly understand thisthen the third one inherited widget is amore complex topic to understand sowe'll be discussing it in the second andthe third app all right so let's removethis for now and let's just think wehave two types of widgets herein terms of UI all right in terms of UIrelated stuff there are only two widgetsinherited widget is for something elseso to understand stateless and statefulwidget you need to understand what stateis all right so to understand the statelet's take an example of our counterapplicationwhat will be the state over here wellState refers to any data that willdetermine how your widget should looklike how it should be rendered or how itshould behave so this text over here canbea state the text below it the 0 is astate why becausethese two things are datathat determine how the widget shouldrender how it should behave how itshould look like right even this app barthis button right here determine how thescreen will look like but that's not thedefinition of state that's thedefinition of a widgetState refers to data that will determinehow the widget should look likeso these two things are data that willdetermine how the widget will look likehow the screen will look like and appbar and this button will determine howthe screen will look like they are notreally data rightso these two things are data over hereso that's what state is to shorten thedefinition you can say state is somedata that your widget will care aboutright now what is stateless widget so itis State less widget does this mean itdoes not have any state at all noit's very unlikely that your app doesnot have any state at all your app willusually have Statesthat's what gives your app meaning rightif I just remove the Zero from here andthis you have pushed the button thismany times text from here do you thinkthis apps this app makes any sense atall not reallyso your app will have state it's veryunlikely that your app does not have astatebut just means that yourapp or your widget will have list Stateand by list State I meanin a stateless Widget the state isimmutable the data is immutable meaningonce the widget is created it cannot bechangedso suppose this was a stateless widgetit's not really a stateless widgetyou'll understand in a moment but ifthis was a stateless widget then thistext wouldn't change at all this textyou have pushed the button this manytimes does not change at all but eventhe 0 would not change when I click overhere all right that's what statelesswould do but stateful does what happensover here when I click on this buttonthe state changes so I hope youunderstood the difference betweenstateless and stateful widget statelessbasically has the state immutable sothe state doesn't change at alland in state full the state can changeit's not immutable it is mutable sowhenever you want mutable state or statethat can change you'll use statefulwizard otherwise stateless measureso for now I've extended my app withstatus widgetbut as soon as I extend the statelesswidget my app gives me an errorit has this red underline which tellsit's an errorand you can see the error is missingconcrete implementation of statelesswidget dot buildwhyif I just remove this extent statelesswidget this is a new class and that'sfine right but I have to extend it witha stateless widget so that it becomes awidget I cannotnot extend it and put it in run app Ihave to extend it so after I extend itit gives me this error meaning statelesswidgetis telling us to override some functionsand we've seen that before because atthe end of the day stateless widget isan abstract class whenever you extend anabstract class you need to override itsfunction and redefine its implementationso what we need to do over here is addup the rate overridewidgetdot build right not exactly why just goto the stateless widget definitionscroll down and you'll find widget buildaware this is what we need to overridethis is what is defined in the abstractgloves now you'll ask heystateless element create element is alsodefined over here right butthat'sdefined whether it's implementationbecause stateless widget is extendingwidgetand widget is basically tellingstateless widget to override a method ofelement create element which is what thestateless widget is doing now if youdon't understand this don't worry fornow you'll understand this later on whenwe get into widget trees elementariesand render objects but for now don'tdon't worry about it if you don't get itbut if you get it awesomeso basicallythe only thing you need to understand asof now is widget build build contextthis thing needs to be defined so we canjust copy itwe can paste it over here with otherrate override at the top then create afunction out of it but this gives us anerror this gives us an error becausethis is a function right we need toDefine its implementation now to Defineits implementationwe have to return a widgetbecause this is a function this functiontakes a build contextand then we need to return a widget fromhereso basically we need to return a widgetand that is why it's giving us an errorthe error saysthe body might completely normal causingnull to be returned but the return typewidget is a potentially non-nullabletype if we had widget like this aware itwould have caused no errors butunfortunately or fortunately that's notthe case we need to return a widget allthe time from a stateless widget so wecan just copy this text right at the topthen return text like this and the errorgoes away also now we can just take thismy app and put it over hereand make sure you have theseparenthesis because it's a class rightyou need to instantiate itand now when you save it and restartyour app you don't see any changes therebut what happened over here is you don'thave to continuously build your appin this run app function you can justpass my app class and now you can startediting in the my app classthat's what I was talking aboutby extending to a stateless widget or astateful widget you're just making surethat your appis divided into smaller pieces if youhave your app divided into smallerpieces many people can work on ittogether andmake more progressso I hope you understood the purpose astateless widget but still we havewarnings to fix we have these blueunderlines to fixsolet's go over them one by onestarting with my app now if you hoverover this you'll see Constructors forpublic widgets should have a named keyparameterthis is basically saying that hey youextended stateless widget now statelesswidget you override the build functionthat's all goodnow you can create your app I won't bugyouwith the compile time or runtime errorsbut I'll still bug you with compile timewarningsand this warning is there because if weagain go to stateless widget definitionyou'll see this Constructor over hereconstant stateless widget super dot keyand it did thisbecause it was extending widget when itextended widget widget requiredsomething known as a key for itsConstructorright you can see it away a constantwidget this dot key so our abstractclass widget requires something known asa keyand whenever you extend an abstractclass you'll have to pass that key tothe super class which is the widget andthat is what stateless widget did Superdot key but where will stateless widgetget its key from it will get it from usus the people who extendstateless.widget the same thing happenedin text as well if you go to textdefinition you'll see class textextending stateless widget because textalso doesn't havean immutable State because if you thinkabout it text also doesn't have amutable state obviously it will onlyhave its own immutable State that's whyit's extending a stateless widget thenit is havingits key defined somewhere over here ifyou just search for it you'll see superdot key so this is what we have to doover here as wellwe need to create a Constructor for myappwhich will be something like this superdot key and now the error goes away nowwhat is the super dot key we've alreadydiscussed about this in the dot sectionif you remember we had a keyor something like this let's say stringdata and then we had to give somethingto the super class we would dodata like this right what happened overhere we are saying that hey you canoptionally pass data to usand if you do pass or if you don't passwe are just going to pass that value toour super classwhenever we use super we refer to theabstract class super right so that'swhat happened over here this requireskey so we have key optionally asked youdon't have to necessarily specify keyevery time you instantiate my appyou can just ask for it and if you don'twant to pass that key you cannot pass inand then you have to mention key overhereso this is what we did when we did Superdot key okaythis is just a shorthand syntax of thislong thing right here but basically thismeans we are optionally taking somestuff from The Constructorand passing it to the Super Widget thewidget we are extending to in our casethe stateless widget and in statelesswidgets case widget now if you don'tunderstand the specifics don't worryabout it you'll still be able to buildapps without this knowledge but it'sbetter to have knowledge so that you canbuild your apps with much more accuracyand now if you see over here as soon aswe add constant Constructor over heremy app asks us to use constant so weneed to put constant over here what isthe purpose of this constantthe purpose of constant is to declarethat this Constructor is a compile timeconstant by making the Constructorconstant you are just telling flood thathey the widget instance that you'vecreated over here this my app class overhere doesn't need to be recreated everysingle time you can just create it onceand that's enough this helps to improvethe performance of the app because thenumber of times this object is createdis quite lessthe same thing comes away when you hoverover this text you'll see use const withthe Constructor to improve performanceso again we have to use constant overhere so before returning many widgetsyou'll have to put const before thembecause it just tells that heythis widget doesn't have to be rebuiltyou won't understand the purpose as ofnow but when we get into thecurrency converter app you'll understandit better which you might have in yourmind what is a key now key is a classthat helps flutter identify anddifferentiate between widgets by passinga key to the Constructor you explicitlyassign a specific key to the specificwidget instance so if I pass a key to myappyou are assigning the key to thisparticular my app instanceand this ensures that the widget isproperly managed byflutter's algorithm to update thewidgets whenever they updatenow this won't make any sense to youbecause keys are used in updating thewidget tree and all of those stuff butyou don't even know what widget tree isas of now so again this is a part thatwe'll cover in the widget TreeElementarytheory part for now let's just get theapp working rightso yeahI hope you've understood it till nowfrom now every step we take will betowards building the currency converterapp so in our app right now we are justreturning a text widget nothing else andthat's cool buthere's the problem I'm not following anydesign guidelines or design rules withinwhich I'm restricted so I can buildwhatever I want so that allows me tobuild really exceptional UI designs orit also allows me to create most of theworst UI designs now I want to make surethat doesn't happen I don't want to seethe worst case scenario when I'm workingwith over 100 Engineers let's say sowhat I want to do is make sure that myapp follows a particular guideline adesign system all right so for thatwe have two types of designs given to usby two major companies now there aremany more Design Systems but these arethe two most popular ones first one ismaterial designand the second one is Cupertino designso what are these designs and who madethem well material design is a designSystem created by Google and Cupertinodesign is the design System created byApplenow you can think of the differencebetween Now Android apps look and howiOS apps look and then you'll be able toknowthe difference between material designand Cupertino design even if you scrollup yours material.dot and thismaterial.dart is named after thismaterial design itself becausematerial.dotif we click on command and go over thereinside you'll see all of the widgetshere we are going to use many of thembut all of these designs arerelated to material designand there's a similarfile in flutter related to iOS design aswell so if we just have packageflutter slash Cupertino dot dot insteadof material dot you can add Cupertinodesign in your app we are going to seethe difference in both of them when webuild our currency converter app but asof now we are just going to focus onmaterial design now how do I make suremy app adds material design so for thatI'm going to return material apps fromhere as simple as that I want a materialdesigned app so I'll return material appnow you can guess for yourself if youwant Cupertino design we can just haveCupertino app and we'll be done and asyou can see it automatically Importscupertino.dot but for now as I said weare just going to focus on material appat the end when we are done completingthe currency converter app we are goingto see how this will look like inCupertino design and what all stuff weneed to change but as of now I'm notgoing to reference Cupertino designanymore we're just going to focus onmaterial designso coming to this material appthere are lots of things we can do overhere and material app just does not setthe material design for our app it alsogives us multiple options to use or toconfigure for example if you hover overthis we have Navigator key scaffoldmessenger key home routes initial routeon generate route and a bunch of routesthen we also have theme and all thetheme related stuff then we havelocalization all the localizationrelated stuff and a lot of small smallthingswhy I am telling you this is becausematerial app allows us toset up navigation for our app if we justreturn a text widget we won't be able tomove from one page to another withoutdoing anything we have to return eithera material app Cupertino app so that wecan set up navigation in our app andsame goes for theming same goes forlocalization internationalization all ofthat stuffnow if you're confused what theminginternationalization localizationnavigation means we'll get to it when weget to those certain topics and we diveinto it as of now you can justunderstand that these allows for a lotof stuff which just returning a textcan't dookay so now I've returned a material appnow what should I do if I just save itand you know restart the app and comeover here nothing shows upeven my text has gone because well I hadreturned text from here and I removed itnow what should I do to return a textagain so for thatI can use one of the properties given bymaterial app which was home so I canjust pass home property here and as youcan see home property requires a widgetthat can be optionalso I can just pass in let's saya text againand now I'll pass in hello world withlet's say four exclamation marks save itand you come over here we see helloworld and now it's a different kind oftext altogetherand you notice one thing I didn't haveto mention text Direction over here Icould just pass in text and it workedfine and I was able to see this textright over herewhy did that happen that happenedbecause material app sets upthe text formatting for your app or thetext design for your app if you presscommand and come over here you won't beable to understand where the text isgiven its direction and all of thatstuff but you can take my word on itotherwise you'll have to dive deep andI'm sure you won't be able to understandany of this even I don't understand itbut the point is how can I make thistext look better because this looksabsolutely terrible right what is this Imean red color text with yellowunderline what is that none of thecurrent apps in our world use thisso how can I change it so to change itwe have to wrap our text with somethingknown as a scaffoldand usually material apphome property is followed by a scaffoldall right so we need a scaffold overhere and in this scaffold we can providethe text and we'll be able to see thetext rendered properly not in a very baddesignso if we put scaffold we'll discuss whatscaffold isand in scaffold we have to provide thetext widget now how can I provide thetext widget well there's no homeproperty over here but there is aproperty of bodyand you can see Stafford provides veryintuitive names for everything over herewe have an app bar app bar is basicallythe thing at the top the header thenthere's body so the body is the middlethingjust similar to an HTML element right soin HTML you have header header is ABBAthen you have body body is this body soit's kind of similar to HTML only if yousee it in one wayso we can pass body aware then our textwidget and then again we will type helloworldand then our for exclamation mark we'llsave it and you come over here somethingelse only shows up we have a whitescreen all of a sudden we have a textshowing up here and it looks wonderfulyou know better than what we had earlierhow did this happenso whenever we use a scaffoldscaffold tells the flutter frameworkthat heythe programmer has used a scaffoldwidget so we need to provideuser or the programmer all thecapabilities to add everything relatedto a material design for example theheader if we don't use a scaffold wewon't be able to add header in any ofour apps material app will set theoverall theming and overall navigationstuff for us but scaffold will make surethat something related to one specificpage is done and scaffold will give usaccess to headers Footers and all ofthat stuff so to make sure youunderstand this material app andscaffold thing let's take a look at adiagramso let's say this big thing right hereis our material app what material appdoes is set up a playground for us sothat we can do everything materialdesign related so we have materialdesign over here we have all thenavigationlocalization internationalizationand theming all of them set up over hereso this looks after the overall app ingeneralso this is kind of like on a globalscaleand what scaffold will do is basicallyin our Global space set up one localspace of its own right over here and sayhey now you can add a header now you canadd a body now you can add a footer thenyou can add a bunch of more stuff likebottom sheets you know showing up adialog box we'll see all of that in ourappbut that's what scaffold does scaffoldlooks after thelocal part and material app looks afterthe global part and in your app you canonly have one material app return rightit doesn't make sense to have materialapp two or three timesbut scaffold it makes sense to havetwo or threebecause if you don't have a scaffoldyour text will be rendered in a veryand you won't like itso I hope you understood the differencewith this diagram and things got clearernow let's jump back into this and nowwhat I want to do ismake sure that my text comes right inthe centerevery time I see my text it's right inthe corner who likes the text in thecorner I want it right in the centerover herehow can I do that I can do that bymaking sure that text has a property ofa centeris that how it works not really if youlook over here you don't see anythingrelated to the text coming in Center yesyou can use text align property whichbasically tells hey where do you want torender your text where do you want toalign it do you want it in the left inthe right in the top in the bottom butthat is only when you havefull access of the screenright now a text widget only occupiesthis much spaceit doesn't have the entire screen toitself if it had the entire screen toitself then it wouldn't be this smallrightif a text had access to the entirescreen it would spread across the entirescreentext only has access to how much spaceit acquires over hereso I cannot use the text align propertyover here and I cannot use any of textproperties to do that because textdoesn't have that much controljust think about it in terms of akingdomif a certain Kingdom if our widget ifour text widget is a certain Kingdom ifour certain Kingdom wants to come overhere how can they come they can onlycome when they have access to the entirearea if they don't have access toanother area then they can't come overhere as a resultthey'll only stay where they have theircontrol to understand this even betterlet's take an analogy let's say ourwidget aware this text widget is akingdom if this Kingdom wants to comeright over here in the center how willit come can the wing kingdom just comeanywhere they want no they have to gaincontrol over this entire space so thatthey can come right in the centerwithout any control on this land or onthis space no Kingdom can just move fromyear to yearso same goes for our text widget for itto come over here it needs to haveaccess to the entire space and the textwidget cannot have that because it onlytakes as much space as it requires onlythis muchso this Kingdom can do nothing about itbut yeahsomething outside the kingdom can makesure this kingdom comes away right so ifthere's another kingdom and the annexthis Kingdomthen they can make sure that thiskingdom comes right away up in thecenter so that's what we want to do wewant to make sure from outside that thistext comes in the center because frominside text does not have any powerso what we need to do is wrap this textwith a center widget that's a widgetprovided to us by flutter so in bodyinstead of having a text returned wireI'm going to have Centerand then Center if you see there arevery less propertieswe have key we have double width Factorheight factor and a childwhat I want to use is neither of thesetwo things and the key is generally notrequiredso we can just have a child and a childis a text widgetso we say helloworld and then for exclamation mark saveit and when you come over here you seehot reload Works away because this isnot a very big change this is quite asmall change to the framework and assoon as I save anythingI don't have to restart this I can justpress command s it hot reloads and I seethe changes in real timeand even our text is centered nowso as you can see material appscaffold Center text whatever Imentioned in the centerwill be centered the same way aswhatever I mentioned in the scaffoldwill be scaffolded so anything youmention inside of the center widget willbe centered so if you want to put abutton over here you can do that if youwant to put an image inside of this youcan do that and it will all be centeredand now we have our first good lookingHello World appnow we want to start working on thecurrency converter app but before thatI hope you've started to realize thiskind of chain ofwidgets that we are makingin material art we add home then homerequired a widget then scaffold bodybody required a widget then we addCenter centers child required a wizardand these are the three things all rightwhenever there's material appthere will be home that you have to usewhenever you have scaffold there will bebody and whenever there's any otherwidget other than scaffold or materialapp you'll have the child property on itexcept a widget like text you knowbecause text is itself displayingsomethingstuff like Center is not actuallydisplaying anything on the screen rightit is just setting the alignment and thelayout but it's not settinganything up on the screen for examplehello world is being displayed on thescreena button will be displayed on the screenbut a center will not be displayed onthe screen it's a way to tell theflutter framework that heyour programmer wants the appcontent to be centeredso it's related to layout it's notreally related to rendering anything onthe screenand this thing right here is also knownas a widget tree whylet's understand that so let's say wehave our material app so we have thisgiant block of a thing which is calledmaterial app so let's call this mthen in material app it has somethingknown as a scaffold then in scaffold wehave a center widget and in the centerwidget we havea text widgetso what have we got herethis is kind of like a tree rightbecause if you just take this and youknowjust reverse everything upmaterial app is the root of our widgetso material app sets the root foreverythingthat's what we saw in the previousdiagram as well material art was settingup everything in the global space thenwe add scaffold which was one of thebranches then we add the center widgetwhich was one of thebranches branches you can say sub Branchthis was another sub Branch so we arecreating kind of like a tree that's whythis is known as a widget tree okay andas I've already said before it's alwaysgood to split up your widgets so what Ilike to do is material app can have alot of configurations done inside it forexample routing can be set up inmaterial app theming can be set up inmaterial app and localizationinternationalization and what not can beset up in material app so this materialapp can be filled pretty much so what Ilike to do is take this scaffold becauseit's a separate page of its ownand put it in a separate file in aseparate class of its own just like wedid with my app when it was in Run uprightwe just want to make sure that thewidget tree always stays small so thatit's easier to contribute to it and it'seasier to understand as wellso what I'll do is create a separatefile aware and the separate file isgoing to be called let's saycurrencyconvertermaterialpage dot dot so you notice theconvention of naming aware of currencythen I wanted to put a space but if Iput a space it will be incorrect namingso I have to put underscore over here sowe have currency underscore converterunderscore material underscore page dotdot dot dot extension needs to be putotherwise vs code can't identifyand even flutter cannot identify thatthis is related to flutter so you needto put the dot dot extension so vs codeautomatically identifies hey this is aDOT fileokay and we have created a new file overherein our lip folder itselfyeahI can go ahead and create my statelesswidget again so I'll call this classcurrency converter materialpage I've given it a pretty long nameyou can just call thismaterial home page I am putting materialover here because later on in our appI'm going to show you the differencebetween material and Cupertino appright so not to cause any confusion I'mputting this as currency convertermaterial pagehowever when we are building other appsin the future I'll remove materialall together from my names because Iwon't be experimenting with two type ofapps material and Cupertino I'm justgoing to have onedesign for my app which is materialdesignbecause personally I like it much betterthan Cupertino designso if you have just one design guidelinewhich is being followed then you don'thave to name it like thisso anyways let's go ahead and extendstateless widget we have already seenthisand it automatically Importsmaterial.dot and one thing to note overhere is every time you import a new DOTfile you'll have to import a newmaterial.dotbecause these import lines are specificto the file if you have importmaterial.dot over here it doesn't meanyou can useit over hereall the import lines are specific totheir files now I'll have to go aheadand create an at the rate overridewidget build then we have somethingknown as build context which we'llunderstandand then I'm going to return this thingright here so I can just copy this andgo ahead and returns scaffold over herealso I'll need to put the key over hereso we'll have constant currencyconverter material pagenamed argumentsuper dot key perfectnow I can take this classcome to the main.dot file remove thescaffold and havesomething like this doneso what I've done is basicallytransferred my entire scaffold widgetfrom the home over here to a particularspecific widget of its own and now I cankeep building the widget tree over hereso this thing this my app class is muchshorter and I can pile up all my UIrelated stuff related to the currencyconverter pagein this particular widget and now if werestart the app there will be no changesat all because we have basicallytransferredeverything in one class to another classand then call that class so essentiallywe are just having material appscaffold Center text the same thing butin different widgetsit's just for our improved visual orimproved working it doesn't have anyeffect on the app till now okayso I hope you've understood everythingtill now if you haveamazing now again we can put Constablewhenever it asks us to let's resolve allthe errors we can put Constable here aswell save it and this looks goodnow before moving forward I need you tounderstand this build context thingwhich is a very very important Conceptin flutterafter widget this is the second biggerconcept that I'm teaching you which isbuild context so what exactly is thisbuild context here what does it do andwhy is it mentioned inside this buildfunctionlet's understand that build context is aclass provided by flutter which tellsthe flutter framework that hey currencyconverter material page is present overhere in the widget tree not anywhereelse it's basically telling the locationof this currency converter material pagein the entire widget tree and every timeyou extend a stateless widget or astateful widget you will have access tobuild context and every widget has thatif you press command and go to thescaffold definition it extends somethingknown as a stateful widget and when wescroll downyou'll see that this also has a buildcontextand same goes for the center and thistext as well so every widget whenextended by a stateless stateful widgetwill have its own build context becauseflutter wants to know its location sothat's what build context does tells youthe location of a particular widget inthe widget treeto understand this diagrammatically howwill flutter knowmaterial app is present over herescaffold is present over your Center andtext are present over herehow will Florida make sure that itdoesn't mess up stuff it doesn't mess upstuff like Center is present over hereand text is present over here because weneed the rendering to be perfect rightif it is not perfect then our app willlook very different from what we want itto look likeso that's where build context helps nowa valid question over here will be ifflutter can do all of this stuff behindthe scenes why is this build contextexposed to us like why do we have accessto build context of air why can't whichit build to be like this and this willbe nice right because we are not usingthe build context anywhere in our codewell that's because we have notimplemented anything that's advanced yetand when we do stuff like navigationmoving from one page to another settingup the theme of our app all of that willrequire build contextit is one of the most important Conceptsin flutter we'll understand the innerworkings of how navigation will takeplace and all of that stuff but keep inmind for now build context is basicallytelling the location of the widget inthe widget tree also one thing that Iforgot to mention in the main.file if wecome and you see you're in a home wehave currency converter material pageinstantiated over herebut thisis coming from package currencyconverter currency converter materialpage dot dot so as soon as we you knowinstantiated it flutter automaticallyimported this particular linewhy let's break it down we have packagecurrency converter what is this packagecurrency converter well if you go toyour pubspect.yaml file scroll up you'llsee the name of your project as currencyconverterover here it's package flutter becausethe name of theflood up SDK is fluttersame way our package name is currencyconverter that's why we have packagecurrency converter like this and inthere we have imported the currencyconverter material page dot dot which ispresent in the lib folder it doesn't golike package currency converter slashlib slash currency converter materialpage dot dot becauseyaml saying name it is obviously goingto be in the lib folder it's not goingto be anywhere else all your Dart filesare present in lib folder nowhere elsethat's why it directly Imports it likethis however if you create a folderinside of web let's saypages so that it's more organized rightand then we shift it inside click onmove you can just drag and drop it andthen we do move extension dot wants tomake refactoring changes with this filemoves basicallysince you've moved the file the importlines will change now so Dart extensionwill automatically do it for us so wedon't have to resolve those errorsnow if we click on OK you see now itspackage currency converter slash Pagesslash currency converter material pagedot dotdot automatically did it for us and onlything that we need to do is press Ctrl sto save the changes made by the dotextension all right so anything in thelib folder will have its import likethis now this is called as packageimporting now there's another type ofimporting you can use here let's removethisand instead of importing it like packagecurrency converter what we can do isrelative importing by relative importingit means whatever file we are in rightnow in main.filerelative to this main.dot file where isthe file presentso relative to main.dot file we have dotslashand when you put dot slash you see autosuggestionsso right now we are in the lib folderall right because that's where main.dotis presentthen we need to go to the pagesfolder so we'll just pass in dot slashpages and there we have our currencyconverter material page so this alsoworks and this is known asrelative importing because this is animporting based on the current file soif you are in main.dot file this is howyou will Traverse over it all right soyou can use either of them it depends onyour preference and it is also based onthe tools you use right many peopleprefer importing like this but manypeople don't prefer importing like thisbut if you're coming from webdevelopment you might have already seenthis in JavaScript code so it shouldn'tbe too difficult for you however itreally depends on you whatever you wantto doalso when you remove this importing yousee the error comes over here becausethis class is not identified this classis not identified because it's comingfrom some other file and we have notimported that file that's why so toresolve this again you can type it likethis or you can just do command fullstop so it will give you a list of fixesthat you can add in your app that willfix this error so the Quick Fix isimporting the library set correctly Iidentified that somewhere in our codethis currency converter material pageclass is present so we can use thatand then it also has this different kindof importing so both are importing butit's just different kind of importingnow we can click over here save it andthen we are good to go also let's pushthis file out in the lip folder againlet dot extension do its job we'll saveit and we'll delete the pages folderbecause that was just for demo pageswill be required later on in our appswhen we build bigger apps right now wejust have two three pages what do youwant to do with that right so let's comeover here and now develop our app nowwhat is required in our app let's breakit down so how is our app going to looklike well first of all we have we aregoing to have a big solid texture layerwhich is boldedwhich says hey this is your answer allrightso this is the converted price and thenwe have a simple text field which takesthe user inputand you can type your currencyover hereand then we have a button which saysconvertso we are going to have three elementsbelow one another present in our apphow do we make sure that happenscan we do it over here in the centertext widget can we put everything in atext widget not really because there arethree different things paste outdifferently so we have a text showing upat the top then we have a text field andthen we have a button those are threedifferent widgets and you can't puteverything in a text widget what youneed to do is make sure that you havesome sort of widget that will make sureyou're able to align everything from topto bottomin a vertical mannerand it accepts many widgetsnot just a single child widget like thecenter has it needs to have childrenbecause it will take in multiple widgetsit will take a text widget it will takea text field widget and it will takea button so we'll remove this text fromhere and instead of putting a centeraway what I'm going to do is put acolumnwhat is a column column is anotherwidget which doesn't really paintanything on the screen it doesn't renderanything it's related to layout it'sbasically laying out our widgets in acertain Manner and how is it doing thatwell it's a column righthow does column work it's something thatgoes from top to bottom and it has anargument of children if you scroll downyou'll see children and it doesn'taccept just a single widget it accepts alist of widgets and we already know whata list isso let's go ahead and pass children awaythen we are going to have our textwidget which says 0 for now okay solet's save it and where did a zero goit's not showing up anywherewell that's because we have removed thecenter widget from hereso again it starts right from the topcorner and that's why zero can't be seenso a simple fix to this can be wrappingcolumn with Center widget again so let'sgo ahead and have Centerchildthen we'll take this column and paste itover heresomething like this all rightnow if we come over here we can see ourzero but still it is centeredhorizontally it's not really centeredvertically it's not coming over hereright it's over hereit's centeredin the horizontal space not in thevertical space to so to center it in thevertical space column has its ownproperties as you can see over here ithas a property of main axis alignmentand it also has a property of cross axisalignment we do know that it's somethingrelated to alignment that we wantandwe have two alignment related propertiesbut which one should we use let'sunderstand the name main axis alignmentsince this is a column what will themean axis of a column be the main axisof a column is obviously the verticallandscape right this is the mainaxis and cross axis is this thing righthereif we had something like a rowthe opposite of a column the main axisof a row will be the horizontal thingand the cross axis will bethe vertical space but since this is acolumncolumn will have its main axis as thevertical landscape or the vertical scapeand this will be horizontal which iscross axis okayso we'll go ahead and put main axisalignment now what does Main axis wantand is it a class an enum what is itso as you can see main axis alignmenthas a preset value so if you don't passanything to main access alignment it hasthe value of main access alignment dotstart what do we want we want Center andas you can see we have suggestionsrelated to it already or if you justpass main axisalignment dot you'll still get all ofthose values and as we know main accessalignment is an enumso since it's an enum we have a bunch ofproperties that we can select so it canbe Center that's what we wantbut let's try other values first so thatwe know what we're talking about then wehave end which is the opposite of startright so instead of our 0 showing upover here it's now showing up over hereif you can't see ityou see this is this part here this is 0then we have space around space betweenspace evenly start now I won't be ableto show you the difference between spacearound space between space evenly as ofnow but when we addtwo more widgets which arethe text field widget and button widgetswill understand the difference betweenall of these three things so stay aroundtill that time and we'll understand thedifference but as of now we know whatstart is we know what end is andobviously Center is basically saying heycome in the centerso since we've aligned this in thecenter does it mean we can remove thecenter widget like this and make sureyourremoving it nicely because when you tryto remove ityou know you have to remove this childyou have to remove the centerand then you also have to remove aparenthesis related to it because thisis a center widget like this rightso make sure you remove it nicely or ifyou can't remove it nicely then presscommand shift ror you can just right clickthen go torefactorthen you get a certain bunch ofproperties over here and you see removethis widgetso what this refactoring option does isremove the current Widget the widgetthat you had right clicked on from thewidget tree and when you do thatBoom the center widget is now gone andthere's only a column and we don't evenget an error so you can always do thatif you don't feel confident in removingit now if we come over here againr0 is gone but where is it gone it'sright over herewhy is it over there because we hadremoved the center widget which centeredthe column horizontally not verticallyvertically we add main access alignmentso for horizontalwe have to put a center widget butwhat's another thing that we can do wellI told you column has the cross accessalignment property as well which willmake sureits position in the horizontal spaceso we can just go ahead and add crossaccess alignment then this requirescross access alignment so we have crossaccess alignment Dot and you see we havea similar set of values we have Centerwe have end we have start and we havestretch so if we putand you know where it will go we know itwhere it will go right so if we comeover here well 0 is not over here it'sstill over here why is that the casethat's the case because column will onlytake up as much space as its childrenwantit will not take anything more than thatwhich is why so column is only taking uspage this much long all right it's nottaking a space like this this entirething is not being taken only this muchis being takenso that's why it cannot go over herebecause column only has a space of thismuch only till where the text isif it had the entire space to itselfit could go over therenow if you still don't understand whatI'm going to do is wrap this column withsomething known as a colored box whichwill make sure that our column can havesome colorbecause column doesn't have a propertyto give itself a color to give itself acolor to give to give column a colorwe'll have to use a different widget wecannot use column because column doesn'thave a color property of its own you cancheck it over here so what I'm going todo is have colored box over here whichis another widget provided by flutterand you see we have color over here wehave to pass in a colorand we can also take this column andpass it as the child so all of this isvery intuitive right because colored boxwhat will it do well it's simple Englishit's a box that is colored so let's putcolor over here but what's color well itrequires something known as a color solet's put it over here and color mightbe an enum but that's not the case coloris a class in itself and if youinstantiate itit will tell you to give it some valuewhich is an integerandit requires something of this sort andwe really don't know what this is so wecan't use this this is not for peoplelike us so what can we use then well wecan go ahead and use some of the staticproperties mentioned on thiscolor classwell we can use some of the methods overhere so we can use from argb from RGB ofalpha blend get Alpha from opacity lovebut what is all of this wellfrom argb is basically telling thatprovided Alpha red green blue colorvalues and then you'll be able todisplay it from rgbo says that give methe value of red green blue opacity andthen I'll be able to display itwhy does it require only red green bluebecause that's the fundamental colorsright those are the base colors based onwhich other colors are made and RGB willperfectly describe any color you want tomakeso let's go ahead and use from rgbo andthen we have to provide a set of valuesfrom 0 to 255.now we don't know any of these now whatis white color well we don't knowbut we do know how to make a red colorbecause red green blue is going from 0to 255 so I can give red the maximumvalue then we have green blue andopacity so if green is 0 blue is 0 andopacity is 0 will that mean I'll get ared color not really becauseopacity basically meanshow much part is visible and you'resaying it is 0 if it is 0 visiblethen it is black color then there'snothing there's blackthat's why we are going to put one overhere which means it is completelyvisible and now you can see in a previewthat we have selected the red coloragain if you didn't understand since redis given its maximum value which is 255green and blue are given 0 and 0 valuesand opacity is 1that's why we get a red color now if wesave it come over hereyou see this is what our column is itdoesn't extend to the entire screen it'sonly this much right away here andthat's why when we put cross accessalignment dot endit doesn't go till here because columndoesn't have this bigger spaceremember what I told about text whentext was over here text can only go awayif the text widget takes that much spacenow column can only take this much spaceso it'smentioned over here now in main accessalignment we could position it at thetop in the middle in this endbecause column takes that much space butcolumn doesn't take the entire widththat's whywe cannot use cross access alignmentover here what we need to use is acenter widget and let's remove colorfrom here save it and then our widget iscentered right over here perfectso that's good we are able to have acolumnwith r0 written right over herenow the next thing I want to do is makesure my zero is styled what did I say Iwant my text to be bolded it should bebigger in sizeso I need these two things to happen nowhow can I do that well we can find aproperty inside of text because textshould have that rightif a text can't style itself what can atext do and if we scroll down and findsomething related tobold andfont size we cannot find thatwhybecause it is all mentioned in onesingle class which is the textile classso we need to mention the style propertyput in a textilewhere font sizefont to it all of those things arepresent so we can go ahead and havestyle then we'll pass textile over herethat's calledand now if you hover over textile yousee a bunch of properties related tostyling of the text we have colorwe have font size that's what we arelooking for we also have backgroundcolor of the text and a lot lot morethingsthis is whyall the styling related to text ispresent in textile since there are somany properties you cannot just put itin a text widget it will be two occupiedover here that's why just put everythingin atextile class encapsulate it in textstyle class and textile can be usedinside of the text widgetso that was the decision making theflood attempt team took and it's clearlypretty goodso now we can put in font size over herelet's say font size is 20 because thisrequires a value of doubleand save it if we come over here thefont size has increased but it's notincreased that much so let's go aheadwith 25 save it come over here and it ismuch bigger still not appealing to me soI'm just going to go ahead and put 35.this looks nicenow you have to keep testing to seewhich font size you prefer the defaultfont size is 14 so if you put 14 whereit will come back to normal or if youdon't mention it at all it will be 14but when you do mention it let's goahead with 45 I think that would be goodyeahand the next thing I want to do is boldit so for building what can I use wellthere's nothing related to Bolding thatwe can see over here but we do have fontweightwhat is font weight well font weight isbasically how much weight the font hashow much bold it is so we have foundweight dot boldavia fontway dot normaland you see font weight requiressomething known as a font to it and fontweight is a class with all of thoseproperties mentioned over hereso we can put font to itdot normal which is the default oneor we can use W 400 W 500 you can keeptesting on your own but I'm going to goahead with the Bold option becausethat's what I want I'll save it and yousee this is bolded now if you want tosee it real time I can do it over hereI'll remove this save itthe Bold is gone now I'll put it back bypressing command set and save it yep nowit is bolded so you can see this worksand also if I put W 700 and save itthere will be no visible differencebecause behind the scenes dot bold isusing W 700 weightand if I put W 400it will come back to normal becausenormalis using W 400 you can see it over herenow if you want something Bolder thanthe normal bolded you can go ahead withW 800or W 900 and that will keep it verybolded but I'll go ahead with thedefault bold option that we have andthis looks bettergreat now if you again want to increaseits size you can do it depending on yourpreferencegood so now we have our text displayingasand how we want itnow again if you want to change thecolor of this text you can do it so youcan pass a color over here and color canbe color dot fromargb now what is argb argb is basicallyAlpha valuewhich is kind of like opacity butinstead of 0 to 1 this extends from 0 to255 so 255 isfully visible and 0 is not visiblethen we have red green blue just like 0to 255 0 to 255 0 to 255.and also if you just go on Google andtype white RGByou'll seethe RGB the red green and blue values ofthe white colorso for white it's 255 255 and 255 so youcan just go ahead and pass 255255 255 and the alpha value is 1 so thatwill makeit white color not exactly because wehave put one over here in the alphaalpha requires a value of 255 and yousee we get a wider value over herenow if we come we are not able to see itvery properly but you can see itthere's a white color over here now ifyou're confused that why is this whitevisible on a white background that'sbecause this background color ofscaffold isnot pure whiteit is white but with a different RGBvalue this white over here is pure whitethat's why we can see it and if you wantto change the background color of ascaffold you can do it so you can cometo the scaffold search for a propertyover here related to colorand you'll see background color overhere where you can pass let's say ablack color so for black you can pass incolor dot from rgbozero zero zeroand one why zero zero zero because whenred green blue r0 that means none of thecolors are present that's when blackwill be made right black is basicallynothing no colorsand now if you see we have a black colorand a white colored text is visibly seenover here now you might be having aquestion that hey why does flutter makeit so complicated to just put a value toput a rightcolor why can't I justname it well you can instead of usingthe color class you can use the colorsclassand then you will have access toa bunch of colors that you can directlymention you don't have to mention therergba valuesso if you want to put green over hereyou can save it then and you see this isgreen color with white text andobviously you need to put comma beforementioning any other property otherwiseit will give you an error because at theend of the day this is a class that isbeing instantiated right and in a classwhen you mention a property you need toput a comma to separate it now you cango ahead and test other colors so youcan have light blue and there are manymany colors but the reason color dotfrom RGB is present because colors dotcannot mention every possible colorbecause there are infinite colors rightyou can make infinite combinationsnot infinite I mean uncountablecombinations so to give you more accessto what color you want we have from argband rgbo which tell you to specify thecolor on your own andmake sure that your background color orany color isthe way you want it to beso we can for now go ahead and typecolors Dotblue gray save itand this looks fine we can keep it or wecan just keep the white coloranything you prefer I would prefermaking the app more visual as of nowlater on we'll get to the minimalisticdesigns all right so now we have coveredthe text widget as well in a column nowtime to put other widgets in the columnbefore this we have never put any otherwidget inside of One widget so everywidget requires only one child but incolumn we have children that's why I canmentionanother widget and what is the otherwidget well it's the text field widgetwhich will allow me to take the userinput and now if I just instantiate itlike this save it I get text field overhere and I can type anything in thistext field right but obviously this isnot what our text field should look likebecause text fields are meant to be morevisualyou know I don't know what this textfield is forit doesn't give me any clue as to what Ineed to type in over here and also thedesign is looking pretty bad so let'schange it by adding some designs in thistext field so let's go over all thestuff we need to add in the text fieldso if we come over here the first thingthat I want to add is basically kind oflike a hint saying that hey this is thething you need to add it's not aplaceholder but it's basically somethingwritten over here andit should show up only when I haven'ttyped anything over hereand when I start typing a number Ishould be seeing it so how can I makesure that kind of hint comes upso for that I'll have to look at theproperties and see if there's a propertyrelated to it and there's somethingknown as style and stood style but ifyou see style takes upvalue of textile if it takes a value oftextiles then it's probably related totext and this is a text field right sothis style isn't related to the style ofthe text feed it's related to the textinside the text fieldso if we just try to edit it out sowe'll type your style text style andlet's say we change the color tocolors.blue all right and then we saveit and then if I type anything you seeinstead of black color I getblue color so this isn't related to thetext field style because this is textiletextile is always related to the styleof the textso from Context we can understand thatthis isn't what we wantalthough we can convert it to Whitebecause the black color over here usedto look badthen we can go ahead and look forsomething elseand the thing we are looking for isnot mentioned anywhere over hereis itwell it is if you see a layer we have aproperty called decoration which handlesall the decoration related stuff in atext field and if you see it requires atype of input decoration and the defaultvalue of it isinput decoration with nothing mentionedinside of it so we can just go ahead andadd input decorationand now input decoration has a lot ofconfigurations you can do why again itis similar to the textile textileencapsulated all theproperties related to a text stylingwhich we can use anywhere outside oftext also right so textstyle could be used over your textilecan be used over here as well in a textfield so similarly decoration is therewhere it requires input decoration andwe can pass anything to an inputdecoration which encapsulates a lot ofpropertiesthere's icon icon color label label textand many more things so let's go aheadwith label because this looks somethingwe would want and this label requires awidgetso we can pass let's say a text sayingplease enter the amount in INR because Iam building a currency converter whichchanges the amount from INR to let's sayUSD all right or we can do the reverseUSD to INR okay and now if we see overhere we have everything showing up inblue colorand when I restart the appwe see please enter the amount in USDover here written in black and when Iclick over here it goes right at the topin blue colorit's not really legible butyeah this is what label islet's go ahead and make some changesfirst of all I want this to show up inwhite color so what I can do is styletextile then I'll pass color to it andthe color will be colors dot why againthen we can save it and we come overhere it's now written in white color sowe can see it in white color now if Iclick over here again this is whiteperfect but is that what we want I don'twant it to be like this for example if Irestart the appI don't want this label to be presentover here when I click over here thelabel shouldstart disappearing you know when I typeanything this label shouldn't be thereright at the top because it doesn't lookgood it's not a small word that can stayaway it's kind of like a big sentenceand it doesn't look good here so it'sdefinitely label is not what we want asof now later on maybe in some part ofyour app you can use it but label is notwhat we want over herethen let's look at other properties thatmight help us label text here we justneed to pass in a string instead of theentire widget now you might ask why dowe have these two differentproperties over here that's becauselabelrequires a widget and you can literallypass any widget to it it's notnecessarily a text that you need to passin it can be anything but with labeltext you need to pass in a stringotherwise you don't have to passanything so that's the difference withlabel you get more customizable optionswith label text you don't get thosecustomizable options however in our casewe could have used label texture then wehad something like this let's remove thetextand only a string over here and when Icomewe are back to normal we don't have anywhite color or anythingso to add the white color we could goahead and use label style which requirestextileso instead of using a text widget we usetwo properties over here and it wouldresult in the same outputokay then this is all floating label allof that stuff basically how do you wantyour label to look when it's over herefloating in the air rightthen you have helper text let's go aheadand replacelabel with helper text and see what itdoes and here you see it says pleaseenter the amount in USD below it doesn'tgive me a label kind of thing and whenwe restart it's the same thing justmentioned over here so that it couldgive us ahint or kind of like help us to knowwhat is to be done over here but stillthis doesn't look good for our use caseso let's find something else then all ofthose to helper style related stuff isthereand then we have the error text sowhenever you have an error related to atext field what should the error showand how should it be shownall of that is written over here againnot what we want then we have prefixicon which we'll get to after we arewe've added the right text that we wantand the right text we are looking for ishint text all rightI'll tell it to you right away otherwisewe'll be scrolling through a bunch ofproperties given to us by flutter sothat we have full control over the UIwhich is a good thingokay now let's come back here put a handtext and then we have please enter theamount in USD save it and we have itover herewhen I clickit doesn't go at the top it's notfloating anymore it's just there andwhen I start to type it disappears andwhen I come back to normal when there'sno text again it gives us a hint of whathas to be mentioned we can alsoconfigure the Style again and then passin textile and then we need to have acolor let's say colors is colors dot whysave itcome back over here and this might lookgood or this might not let's try adifferent shade aware so we have whiteand then a bunch of different shadesrelated to white white 10 white 12s why24 and so on let's go ahead and drive by38 save it it's kind of like gray but Idon't like it that much maybe Whitenot 12 white 60I think I'll go ahead with thisit's not exactly Whiteso the entire focus is not over herebut it does its decent job good enoughand now you might have noticed that whenI don't put commas between all of theseproperties the formatting of the text orthe code goes wrong for example when Iput a comma here and Savethere's a good formatting done howeverwhen I remove the commaall of these brackets come together socomma helps with indentation andformatting in our code by indentation Imeanyou see how bodies written over herethen their Center then there's a gapthis Gap is known as indentationthis helps us to know what kind ofwidget tree we are in for example thiscolumns children all have are in thesame line all right but the centerhas its own line over here these linescan help us to know wherewe are in the widget tree and that willhelp us a lotwhen we especially work on bigger appsalso you can see these comments rightover here which tell you that hey thisis the end of the textile this is theend of the input decoration this is theend of text field this allows you toquickly know where you are in your codeand add stuff quicklyso we have our text field over herethat's good now what I want isan icon over here that says you knowa money icon kind of thingso it's like a dollar that shows thathey you need to enter the amount hereso that people who don't know Englishcan follow along what they need to doso here in our input decoration itselfwe have a property where that we sawprefix icon rightso if we type prefix there are a lot ofprefix stuff prefix which requires awidget prefix icon which also requires awidget then prefix icon color prefixicon constraints prefix style and prefixtext so prefix text is you know what ifwe just pass string over hereand let's say hellosave it you see prefix text is the textthat shows up beforethe normal hint that you have and alsowhen you type somethingthe prefix icon stays there but the hintgoes awayand a cursor also starts after theprefix icon or the prefix textbut prefix text is not what we want whatwe want is prefix icon or prefixtouch itso we can go ahead and use prefixbut here what will a prefix be I need toadd an icon over here how do I add aniconis there a widget for it yup which isiconicon is another widget if you presscommand you'll go in the source codeclass icon extends stateless widgetso you can add your icon over here butthe icon requires a positional argumentof Icon datawhat is this icon data well let's passit I can data and when you initializethis it asks you for some code pointand this code point is basically used tocreate what kind of Icon you want nowyou can ask your AI assistantto create some code point for you but weare not going to do that because Imyself don't understand most of thestuff insideof eichen datalike there's font family which you caneasily understand font package but whatis code point and how do you figure itout right so let's ignore that icon datais not meant for people like usit's for advanced developers and if youwant to become one you can just go aheadand Google about ithowever what we can do here is passiconswhy because if you click over here withcommandabstract final class icons can be putinside of an icon widgetand with this icons class we have a lotof material iconsyou can see all of them over hereand when you click on this Arrow righthere not anywhere else just the iconyou'll be able to see the icon previewso we have ABC ABC outline ABC roundedand a lot more stuff you can just goahead and see what you want I want adollar sign is there something relatedto a dollar sign not really so we canskip this let's go back and trysomething new so we have icons Dot Moneyrelated stuffyup money is there then there's moneyoff and money off is a dollar symbolwith Slash on it so maybe moneyunderscore on is there without a slashsymbol but that's not the case clearlyso we cannot use anything like thatsoyou need to experiment over here to findyour icon otherwiseyou can just go ahead and Google stuffbut if I just do icons dot monetizationon I see this dollar sign now if I putmonetization on outline I get it justoutline then rounded then Sharp thenthere's money so let's go ahead and seewhat all is there in modernization andthis is all that's there so we're goingto go ahead and use this also put acomma so that formatting is therecool soa comma is requiredbefore everyproperty mentioned inside a classbut it's not required when you have likemultiple parenthesistogether okayso you can have it like this butobviously Comma just makes stuff betterand it's more readable codeso let's see if this come over here wehave our dollar symbol showing up whichis nice now instead of using prefix whatI'll do is go ahead and use prefix iconto see the difference and you see prefixicon properly places it like a iconbecause thisprefixrequires a widget and you see prefixicon does the proper job of putting anicon before it so it leaves some marginfrom here you can see there was a lot ofspacing added then this icon wasproperly placed in the text field notabove or below and took the defaulttheme of our app which was the bluecolorso I can obviously go ahead and changethe prefix icon color this requires tobe a type of color so I can just havecolors dot maybe black not black let'sgo ahead with white againyepand if you want you can just make thisoutline so you get an outline icon overhere perfect and if you want to matchthe color present over here and colorfor the icon you can do that so let'scopy it and paste it like this save itand this looks better because both ofthese things are merging with each otheryou knowgood stuff now insteadnow what if instead of I adding my iconover here I want to add it right at theend what should I do then so for that wehave similar properties called suffixsuffix icon and all of that stuffsame things so suffix will make sureyour icon is over here and suffix I canwill properly place itthen we can put suffix I can colorinstead of suffix iconand then you know you get the samethings so instead of adding the icon inthe left hand side you have the icon nowin the right hand sideso it'sprefix and suffix right butbut in our app it doesn't make sense toput the icon over here so let's shift itin the left hand sidelet's put prefix icon here I'm justpressing command set to go back then Ican have prefix icon and prefix iconcolor this looks goodnow the next thing that I want is mytext field to be coloredI don't want it to be transparent likehere I want it to take a white propercolorso for that I'll have to go ahead andadd another property which islet's find itand we see a property here which isBoolean filled color filled color colorFocus color color hover color so let'sgo ahead and pass fill color and ourcolor is going to be colors.white let'ssave it and we don't see any changesmaybe we need to hot restart so when wehot restart we still don't see anythingwhy is that the casewell that's case because you'vementioned the fill colorand it says that is the base fill colorof the decorations container color nowmaybe you don't understand it but itbasically is the right property to colorit but before fill color we need to addfilled set it to true and then only wesee the white backgroundright now this looks gooddoes itbut now since we've made it whiteeverything has disappeared from here allthe white 60 and all of them have goneso maybe we can shift them to Blackso I'll change the icon and the text toBlack again and we see the right thingnow this looks much better however ifyou just zoom in or I'll just zoom infor you by taking a screenshot to take ascreenshot on the screen you can presscommand sso you basically save the screenshot nowI've taken a screenshot and when I zoomin you'll see there is a blue backgroundover herenot a blue background you can see but ablue border colornow how do you remove that bluebackground color and you know replace itwith something you want in my caseI'll be happy if it is this color thebackground color of the scaffold or justa white color so that it merges with allof that stuffso let's look for something borderrelated in our input decorationand we do have a bunch of propertiesjust related to a border let's go overthem so if I put in Border there's aborder propertybut we don't have to be concerned withthat I'm just going to skip that one andwe are going to focus onthe focused border why because Focusborder is a border that displays whenthe input decorator has a focus and isnot showing an errorso what is that thing wellright now my border or my input or mytext field is not focused when I clickover here there is a blue border thatshows up correctthat is focused border so I just need touse that so I can just have focusedborderand then I can pass an outline inputborder then I can just pass an inputborder the thing that it requires soI'll just go ahead and pass it in overhere but as you can see it gives me anerror saying abstract classes cannot beinstantiated try creating an instance ofa concrete subtype basically inputborder is an abstract classso I cannot use thatso let's remove that and find a classthat basically inherits from inputborder so basically extending from inputborder so you need can type input borderand we do see two type of classes hereoutline input border and underline inputborder let's go ahead and use outlineinput border first then save itand now if you see the color of when itis in Focus has changed it has changed alittle bit rightif I just restart the app again I clickover here you see it kind of enlargesand then there's a thick black bordershowing instead of a blue border whylet's take a look at the properties ofoutline input body to understand thatthere's Border Side border radius andGAP padding let's take a look at BorderSide so if I pass in Border Sideit requires a type of Border Side so Ican just go ahead and use Border Sideand when I go overboard aside this classhas its own bunch of properties it hascolor width style and stroke align sothe first one is color which hasconstant color of 0 xff and six zerosso how do we understand what color thisisto understand that let's understand theformat the colors are inso every color influtterhas a type which is like 0xaarr GG BB so first you need to mention0x then you need to mention that Alphavaluesthen the red value then the green valuethen the blue valueso here we have0 x f f zero zero zero zero zero sothat's 0x then Alpha is FF then we havetwo values for r two numbers for G andtwo numbers for B that meanswe have RGB of 0 0 0 that means we havea black color and that is why we have ablack color showing up over here sincethe default color ofthe Border Side is 0x and when we firstcreate anoutline input border by default itcreates a Border Side instance that iswhythe color is default by black but we canchange it so let's go ahead and changeit we have colors dot let's sayWhiteor colors.red let's go ahead withcolors.redthen we come over here and there's a redcolor showing up now the red color isquite small right so I can increase itswidth so I can pass the width as let'ssay 10.0 come over here and here it is amassive width over herenow I don't want that much let's put itout toand this looks betterthen we have style so what style of theBorder do you wantand this requires a type of Border styleso you can have border style dot none orsolidso let's have border style dot noneand then there is no border at allbut if I put solid it puts a solid thickline hereand then there's stroke align which hasa value of stroke align insideso we have stroke align but stroke alignrequires a double value how can you passin stroke a line inside well that'sbecause strokea line inside is a property mentionedinside of Border Side itself so we haveBorder Side Dot strokaline Center bordersites dot stroke align inside and BorderSide dot stroke align outsidethat is why in stroke align you seestroke align inside however when youjump inside herestroke align inside is a valuestroke align Center is also a value andstroker line outside is also a valuethis is negative one this is 0 and thisis one displaying where you want it doyou want the border to be inside in thecenter or outsidelet's take a screenshot of this emulatorto understand it better to take ascreenshot you just have to presscommand s and that will take itand then when you scroll inside you'llsee that this is the part whereour text field is ending and our borderis displaying inside if I want it rightin the center or outside where the textfieldgets over I can do thatso I can just have Border Side Dotstroke align inside stroker line outsidelet's put stroker line outsideand you see the differencenow it is at the outside it doesn't feelinside now this is a very minor changebut it does affect the UI a little bitlet's put some commas and there we gonow I'm just going to remove red becausered doesn't look good I'll just putblack because black looks solidand now let's exit this because I wantedit outside and that's goodor maybe we don't want it outside we cankeep it inside perfect now the nextthing is whenever I type something itshows up in white color so I need tochange it to Black again so I can justhave thestyle over here the text style which isrelated to what the user enters tocolors.black and now when I typeanything it looks good perfect the nextthing that you might want in your textfield input isthis thing right here is slightly curvedyou want it completely curved like itshouldn't look very rectangle it shouldlook something like this right so if youwant that kind of text field you canchange that by editing one propertywhich is the Border radius so you canpass border radius over here and Borderradius requires a type of Border radiusso you can have borderradiusbut if you do this much it's not allowedbecause border radius if you go overthere doesn't allow you to gobecause border radius has a Constructorthat is private however when I removethe instantiation I only have a type ofBorder radius so I can click and go overthere but if you see border radiusConstructor is not present at all aclass of water radius is present butthere's nothing related to Bod radiusConstructor also you'll see some newstuff over here you have border radiusdot alland that is not a static method whybecause it's named after border radiusand Border radius isthe name of the class so that means itis a Constructor and this is a namedConstructor not the named argumentConstructor but the Constructor has itsown name that you can useso we are going to use exactly that weare going to have border radius Dot andit has a lot of stuff 0 which basicallyeliminates the entire border radius nowyou see the curve is gone it is aperfect rectangle but that's not what wewant we want border radius dot all so inall the directions of your text fieldwhat border radius you need to put inhorizontal so from the left hand theright side what you want only so fromtop left side from top right sidewhat you wantso horizontal basically allows you tohave a little bit more customizationthan all and only has full control overyour entire text fieldthen you have vertical so you have topand bottom circular so you want tocreate a border radius where everythinglooks circularand then you have look which is linearlyinterpolating between two border radiusobjects but you don't need to care aboutit that muchyou can get most of your stuff done withthese five thingslet's go ahead and try border radius dotall 10 and then save it but if we dothis we get an error why because thisrequires a type of radius not an integerso we need to remove this and passradiusand it's a positional argument so youcan just pass in radiusand again radius Constructor is notdefined you have to use radius dotsomethingso always whenever you want to figuresomething out because obviously you'llfind out later on that there are so manywidgets you won't know everything aboutthem but you can always know what allproperties they need and it's in veryEnglish language there's nothingvery UI related language that'smentioned over here that you can'tunderstand so you can just figure out bydoing this radius but it doesn'tresolve the error because itsConstructor doesn't exist so let's tryto do something with radius Dotand yeah we do get options for that andyou see here we have image descriptionsfor itwhat is circular what is elliptical whatis love but we are just going to goahead with radius dot circular and passin 10 which is what circular requires aDouble Radius valuethen save itbecome aware and this is more roundedbut we can make it more rounded byhaving 40 and you see this is properinput that one might requirethen we can also pass in 60and thismakes it even more circularso you get the point now let's trysomething else we have border radius Dothorizontal and from the left side we aregoing to have radius dot circular 60okay let's see what happens you seefrom the left hand side there is thisradius but on the right hand side it'sstrictly edgyand if we do it for right we have rightdot circular like this so this is pointya perfect rectangle and then we haveCircle over hereso you can create a bunch of things likethis with horizontal with vertical invertical you have to mention top orbottom you can pass in topand it's something like this then youhave bottomwhere you have something like this soyou can try a lot of stuff and maybe itlooks cool sometime maybe it doesn't butI'm just going to go aheadwithborder radius.all becausethat's better in my opinion a standardway now you can also try to putonly here and go ahead and configureeverything from top left top right andeverything but you get the point I'm notgoing to dive much into this nowand now finally if we try circularcircular gives us an error becausecircular doesn't require radius itrequires a double valueso let's remove this and put 60. is thatfinenot really it's giving us an error whywe have put a double value rightwell that's because if we go to thecircular partevery Constructor here has a constconstant border radius dot all constantborder radius dot vertical constantborder radius dot horizontal butit's not border radius dot circular witha constant it's just border radius dotcircularthat's why this isn't a constantConstructorand right at the top we have mentionedreturn constant scaffold since we havereturned constant scaffold all of itswidgets need to be constant like Centerwas a constant and column was a constantand likewise even text and textile textfield textile everything was a constantbut finally we have something which isnot a constantso what do we need to do we just need toremove a constant scaffold from hereput a constant text put constant textileput constant textile over here putconstant Border Side and that's allour error gets fixed and we need to putconstant for every single widget whichis a constbut since this wasn't a constWe cannot put constant over here or onany widget here if we put constant awarethat won't be allowedWe cannot put constant on any parentwidgetfor Border radius the parent widget willbe Border Side outline input border notborder side only out or outline inputborderinput decorationtext fieldcolumn Center and scaffoldso you can't put constant on any of itsparents widgetparent widgetis whatever widget border radius is inand it's inoutline input border input decorationtext field and stuff like that okayso I hope you understood that we aregoing to know more about constant andwhy it's required after we have built asuccessfully working applicationbut for now just follow along and useconstant every timenow if we come over hereit's the same output border radius dotcircular 60 has the same output asborders hook radius dot allradius dot circular60. all rightbecause at the end of the day we arejust sayingfrom all the edges you want to puta radius that is circular which is 60and Border radius dot circular also saysthat from all the edges you want to putcircularwhich is 60. okay so it's the same thinghowever I don't want any of thator maybe I do want border radius dotCircle let's say nor maybe5and that will be good enough for me andwe are pretty much done with everythingbut if you see one thing when we restartour app we have our text field looking abit weird and when we click over it itenlarges and it just feels very weirdyou know so what I want to do is makeour text field look like this from thestart okay when I click over here when Ihave the focusand when I don't have the focus itshould look the same thing so for thatwe have a different border propertywhich isenabled borderwhen I put enabled border it alsorequires the same thing input borderand since input border is an abstractclass I cannot use it but I can useunderline input or outline input what isunderline input underlined input if wejust instantiated and restart our app wecan't see anything visible but if wetake a screenshot come aware and zoom inyou'll see there's a border only in thebottom there's no border at the topthere's a border only in the bottomwhich is black which is what underlineinput border is instead of havingborders everywhere like you have anoutline input border you just have anunderline borderand then you have board propertiesrelated to it which is Border Side whichwe've already looked at over herethen it has border radiuswhich we already saw and that's it nofurther customization so that's not whatwe want what we want is this outlineinput border so I can just grab thispress command C to copy it and paste itover here also put a comma so thatformatting works and when we come overhere you see when I click over here andwhen I don't collect it's the same thingbut yeah this makes my widget look verybig so what I can do instead isin my build function itself I'll createfinalborderwhich is equal tothis outline input border that I justsavedso at the end of the day this is afunction right and in a function I cancreate my own variable which I'vecreated over here I've created a bordervariable and assigned it a value ofoutline input border if I hover over itdot currently correctly recognizes itnow I can take this border and paste itover hereI can take this border and paste it overherewhat this does is reduce the complexityinside my input decorationbecause I'm not writing big big stuffhere which are the same thing and alsowhenever I want to change anything I cando it one place if I had two differentinstances over here and maybe I wantedmy border style to have a width of 10then it would be weird why because rightnow it looks normal when I click over itit looks very weirdbecause I changed the stuffin my focus border but I didn't changeit in the enabled border I also need tochange it over here right and then whenI start it it feels the same thingso what I've done instead iscreated a variable border here then tookthis borderpasted it over here pasted it over hereand then whenever I want to changesomething I can just do it at one placeand it correctly changes rightso I hope you understood that and thisis a build function this is a functionwhere I can create any variable that Iwant and I've created it over here I canalso create it over here in my class butit has some problemsbecause this is a cons Constructor I'veused body radius dot circularso I'll have to remove constant fromhere for it to workand we've already seen that const hasperformance benefitsso you should not remove it from TheConstructor of a widget at least as muchas you canand we can avoid it by putting this inthe build function so why not but yeahone thing to note is don't putany complex task inside of this buildfunction yeah you can put variables andyou can put functions that are notexpensive that means that they are notdoing big big stuff like putting anasynchronous thing over here or puttinga timernothing like that needs to be done inbuild function build function shouldhavea widget tree that is to be returned andmaybe if you want you can putvariables over hereokay perfect so my text field looks goodokay let me change my width back to2.0yeah so we are done with the text fieldand we have taken a look at a lot oftext Field properties there are still alot more that we can coverbutlet's not get into them so the designfor the text field looks good enough Ithink we can exit from herebut there's still two more things that Iwant to fix first one is this text fieldbeing too much in the corners all rightI want some spacing to be there fromhere from here all right from the leftand the right hand side and anotherthing is when I press command K whilebeing on the text fieldwe get ourkeyboard hereokay when I press command key I getaccess to the keyboardif you're on Android emulatorkeyboard is constantly there on theAndroid emulatoryou see our keyboard allows us to puttext related stuff here I don't wantthat I want to restrict it to numbersonly you shouldn't be seeing textyou should only be seeingnumbers hereso let's go ahead and puta property that will make suretext field doesn't allow you to puttextonly numbersso that property is not mentioned ininput decoration input decoration isrelated to how you want to design anddecorate your text field but this is notrelated to designing the text field it'srelated to one of the properties orfunctionalities of text field so we canclick over hereforeigntype we want to change the keyboard onlyright so we have keyboard type herewhich we can change so let's go out ofthe input decorationand pass in keyboard type and thisrequires a type of text input type so wecan go ahead and mention text input typeDot and this is an e and this is a classthat allows us to put multiple things sowe have text input type dot date time soif you only want date related stuffand you can see on iOS it requests thedefault keyboard but on Android itrequests a keyboard with ready access tothis because iOS doesn't have an Androidstyle keyboard and iOS doesn't have andAndroid doesn't have IOS style keyboardobviously so let's go ahead and see whatwe want we want number so we can havenumber andwe restartedwe click over here and we see onlynumbers that's good righthowever the problem over here is yeah Icannot puttext but I cannot also put decimalpoints I want decimal points so let'sfind something else so we lovenumber phone street address but we alsohave number with options so this allowsus to put a decimal pointif I save this much and restart the appcome over hereno changes howeverI do have two named properties that Ican configure decimal and signed if Iput decimalset it to True save itagain we need to restartcome awarewe have a nice decimal point showing upover here 8.0and if you want you can also set signedto True which allows you to put negativesign again we'll have to restartcome awareand you seewe get all of those stuffso basically we get all the alphabetsand everything but our keyboard startswith showing a numberbut that's not what I want so I'll justset decimal to true and set this asconstant because this has a constantConstructorso yeahlet's restart the app and there we goperfectnowthe second thing that I wanted is thepadding over here or the margin to beleft from the left side and the righthand side some spacing needs to be therebut I cannot do that by using one of theproperties of text field why becausetext field doesn't have those propertiesit doesn't have anything related tomargin padding all of that stuff butthat's not the case it does havesomething related to padding which isscroll padding and if we see indecoration becausewe are decorating the text field only wehave content padding but those aretwo things that are related with insideof the text field with content battingbasically you can set paddingsuch that you can leave space from hereyou can make sure that your text fieldlooks bigger and this text hasmore padding to itso this text field will appear stretchedbut that's not what we wantand the scroll padding is nowhererelated to what we wantit configures a padding to edgessurrounding a scroll level when the textfield Scrolls into view nothing that wecare about so we can exit this so textfield is not giving us any property andrightly so how can text field give us aproperty related to the outsidefor that we'll again have to wrap ourtext field with other widgetand what is that widget well it can bepadding or container widgetlet's take a look at both of thosewidget paddingand containerso I'm just going to wrap my text fieldwith the padding widget and for that Idon't have to write padding and all ofthat stuff what I can do is press Ctrlshift rwhich brings up a set ofrefactoring options or you can justpressright click refactor and then you haveaccess to the refactoring option andhere you can wrap with the widget youcan wrap with a builder other widgetsthat are presentand then you also have container andpadding so let's wrap it with paddingand you see there's padding then thepadding property and then a child so itcorrectly configures itself so we don'thave to do much task with it then wesave itand then there's paddingso what's happening over here is thistext field text field usually takes upthe entire width of the device or theentire width that it's givenbut here you are restricting it to takethe entire width that isprovided by adding padding and paddingis the amount of space by which toinsert the childso basicallytext field has a habit of taking theentire screen you're saying that hey youcannot take the entire screenand you're restricting itby putting a padding widget whicheliminates 8 pixels of screen size andalso padding requires something known asagencies geometry but if you just doEdge in sets geometryit won't allow you becauseit is an abstract classbut Edge in suchextends its agent's geometry so you canuse it over here now you see how theentire flood of framework is built onthe concept of inheritance encapsulationall the object oriented programmingConcepts that we learned aboutbut anyways this is good and I thinkthis is a nice startagencies dot all eight is quite goodover here and it looks good howeverthere are more properties on edgeinstance that you can take a look atagentsets dot all agencies Dot from ltrbwhich is from left top right bottomthen you need to mention all of thosethings then you have Dot from viewpadding so you can set a padding basedon The View padding then we have only soyou can set left upright bottomnow you might ask what's the differencebetween from ltrb and only well thedifference is all the properties insideof only are optionalyou can pass them and you cannot passthem it's fine if you only want to passleft you can pass it and you'll be goodrightbut on the other hand when you have fromltrb you necessarily need to mention allof those parameters you need to mentionleft top right bottom values you cannotskip any one of themor you can just pass in zero but yeahthis is just more customization addedfor you but we are just going to goahead with onlynot all why not allbecause when we leave live with all youlive by leave padding from your fromYear from year and from bottom as wellwhen we add a button you'll see thatbut withonlyalreadysymmetric where you need to mention thehorizontal and vertical valuesyou can leave spacing from year and yearor from year and yearso you need to set for vertical togetherand from horizontal together that meansif I pass in horizontal 10 and save itfrom left I'm leaving 10 pixels fromright I'm leaving 10 pixelsbut from top and bottom I'm leaving 0pixel that's how it works and I thinkyou're smart enough to figure it out onyour ownwe are going to go ahead with let's sayagencies dot all 10becausewe need to leave some space from hereand we need to leave space from belowwhen our button comes alonggreat this looks goodnow instead of using padding you canalso use container so if I use containerinstead of paddingit all works fine why because containerallows you to set a bunch of propertiesit has alignment padding colordecoration width height so it's like aone and all widget rightit allows you to set multiple propertiesand if you justcommand click on container and just goto its build functionyou'll notice thatcontainer is itself made up of multipleother widgets like you might have seenthe agent says geometry the paddingwidget so whenever we set the paddingover here in our container you'rebasically using the padding widget onlythen we have the color where we areusing colored boxand when you see marginor constraints it is using a bunch ofother widgets is what I'm sayingnow here you can set padding or marginnow what is the difference betweenpadding and marginto understand that let's take a look atthe diagramif I just remove thiswill be able to draw something so let'ssay we have a screen like this maybe abetter screen okaynowthis is where my app residesso this is my text that is displayingokayso I have my text over herenow the spacing between thetext and this container box is known aspadding all rightthis thing right here is padding butthis thing right here is marginso to explain it in a short sentencemargin is related to stuff outside yourcontainerand padding is related to stuff insideyour containerbut in this case the padding and marginwill be the same thing so if we save itour text field decreases even furtherbut in certain scenarios you'll seecontainers padding and margin propertybehaving differently especially when wehave a container with a text inside ofitand maybe you can check it out over herehow let's press command shift R then youhave wrap with container propertyand your you know you can just pass in achild then in the container you canfirst of all setthe padding property which is going tobe constant Edge in such whenever youhave padding or margin related stuff youneed to use Edge and sets then you haveagencies.all 10 then you have margin ofagencies.all 10 again this is going tobe constant and then you can set a colorproperty and the color is going to becolors.black okay let's save it comeover hereyou see first thing to note is thecontainer takes only as much spacethe font requires it doesn't take theentire width of the screen like the textfield doesit only takes as much space as itas its child requiresonly as much space as this text requiresif I reduce its font size to 1 it willtake only this much space if I increaseits font size it will take as much spaceas this text requires even column didthe same thing right we have seen thatearlier container does the same thingso basically the child is determininghow much the height and width of thecontainer should be unless Ispecifically go ahead here and typeheight should be 400 which should be 299okay then it doesn't follow theconstraints or the sizing of text ittakes the entire space however I'm notdoing thatbecause here I want to achieve adifferent purpose as you can see overherethere's some sort of padding over herehowever when I remove thisthe container is squashed even furtherright with this padding I am determininghow much spacing should be there overherebut when I remove paddingI'm not configuring anything inside butwith margin I'm configuringsomething over herewhen I remove margin from here you'llnoticethat this goes down all right let's saveit and you'll see the difference betweenthis text fieldand the text size decreased because themargin is removed when I put back marginlet's put all of them in one screen sothat you understand this furtherand then when I save ityou can visibly see the difference overhereso that's the difference between paddingand margin padding is related to thestuff inside and margin is related tothe stuff outside I hope that was clearnow let'smaximize our code editor and this looksgood now also let's remove the color andthe entire container property so I'llpress Ctrl shift R remove this widget soI remove the entire container and itsproperties and we come over here thislooks good now the next thing we want todo is adda button but I hope before going intothe button you understood the differencebetween padding and container padding isjust one widget and container is made upof many many other widgets and thatincludes the padding widgetbut I always prefer using padding whenonly padding is required you know I getto knowwhat exactly is happening over here if Iuse container I'll be curious to knowhey am I doing anything else in thecontainer but anyways it depends on yourpreference there is no performancedifference and now the final thing ofour UI the button now how do we put abutton over here so in material designbuttons can be classified broadly intotwo categories one is the buttons whichare raised and other one is where thebutton appears like a text all rightso the race button is kind of like anactual buttonthat you might see on anywebsiteappears like a text button is somethingthat looks like a text but is actually abutton so first let's take an example ofhow text button looks and then we can goon to the raised buttonso to create a text button we have totype textbutton how convenientand now it requires two arguments whichis on pressed and child when I click ontext button it automatically completesthis for me and asks me to put therequired arguments so for onpressed werequire something known as void functionand that can be nullable so basically weneed to pass in a function over here andwe can take the advantage of anonymousfunctions that allow us to create afunction over hereso this function does not have a name ofits ownbutit is a functionkind of like a Lambda function in Pythonif you've coded in itthen we have a child which requires awidget now why do we require a child ina text button that's because there willbe a button but what should the contentinside a button bethat's what child requires so we canpass a text wire which says click meall right now I'll just put commas sothat there's nice indentationnow I'll come over hereand you see click me is shown over hereand this acts like a button why becausewhen I long press over itit gives me a splash effect that you cansee in the blue colorthat's a buttonnow if I click on it nothing happensthat's because in this function we havenot done anything so in our functionover here we can passlet's say a print call so we'll go aheadand pass print here and says buttonclick we already know what a printfunction is right and here I'm justsaying that whenever this button ispressed I want the print statement to beprinted out in the console so I'll presscommand J to open my debug console againnow I'll just restart my entire appcome over here click on this buttonand you see button clicked if I click itagainI see two written over here that meansbutton was clicked again now if I againclick there's three times button clickedso this is what this function doeswhenever you click on itit runs the particular functionand it requires a type of only functionyou cannot put some integer value overhere or some string value over here orwhatever you cannot do that because itis of the type function like this and itreturns a void so you don't have toreturn anything from here like this youcan just do thisor you can just leave it because that'svoid now let's see why we get these twoerrors this error we get becausewe have to put a const before a textthis text button does not require aconstantnow you might ask why why does it notrequire a constant when this is has aConstructor of constant that's becausewe have this function over here wheneverwe have a function to be passed inlike thisit cannot be a constant button to provethis if I just remove on pressed you seewe geta warning here use const with theConstructor to improve the performancebut then we also get an error saying thenamed parameter on press is requiredso this is the reason why we have to puta const for the text if const for a textbutton was allowedthen we wouldn't have to put a constantfor this textI've explained this to you before andlet's go ahead put a constable now whyare we getting a warning over here andone problem I have with warnings is thatI have to hover over them to understandwhy the warning is there in the firstplacesowhat can I do such that my warnings areseen over here I don't have to hoverover a particular thing and see thewarning so for that we have a vs codeextension we can go to the extensionstab type yourerrorlensthen we have to choose this onegiven by Alexander we can installand now you'll see your errors andwarnings are seen in the same lineso this error lens makes sure that allyour warnings and errors are seen in thefile itself and you don't have to hoverover them I just prefer this way becauseI get to know instantly what the warningor error isand it says don't invoke print inproduction code try using a loggingframework and this error is therebecauseof a certain thing known as lint which Itold you I'll cover later on now if youagain go to analysis option.yaml you seeinclude package flutter lens and that iscoming from the dev dependency flutterlens surveyorwhat flutter lens does is encourage goodcoding practices you can see that in thecomment over herenow you can set your own codingpractices in the analysis option.yamlfile where you have the linter forexample if I an uncomment this line soI'll press command slash to uncommentthe line then I'll click on command swhich saves the file and come over herethe warning for print is gone even if Iopen the debug console in problems thereare no problemsbecausehere I've set a rule saying that avoidprintlint should be set to falseif I set it to True which is by defaultand come away I get the warning againand I'm not going to meddle with thepresetlint whichtells us to not use print and productioncodeand that's simply because if you printstuff out you can also printsome confidential information andbecause of that your users might be ableto see it if they have rooted devices orthey figure out a way to do soso definitely we are not going to useprint like this there are two options touse print noweither you can go ahead and use debugprintthe difference is debug print requires astring only you cannot pass anything toa print statement like we could in printbecause it required an objectand we already know object is a superclass of all the data types we knowso now we can use debug print and thatremoves the warning for usor what you can do ispass an if check over here and check ifwe are in debug modeonly then do we want toprint thisnow what is debug mode now there arethree types of mode in our applicationsdebug release and profileright nowwe are in the debug modebasically just testing our applicationbuilding new features and all of thatrelease is how your app will look likein productionand profile is a mixture of debug andrelease and release you won't be able toseemany error messages or later on we'llsee that when we add some other packagesthey also print stuff out we won't beable to see that in release mode we cansee that only in debug mode now whatprofile does is run the app and releasemodebut give us our nice error messageswarning messages if there are anyand basically print is saying that heyyou can only use me in debug mode so nowthat's why we are put debug printnow we are saying that hey if we are indebug mode now how do we check if theapp is in debug mode or in release modeto check that we have K debug mode givento us by flutternow if you see this is coming from thepackage flutter Source Foundationconstants dot dot if we press commandand go inside you'll see K debug mode isequal to not release mode and notprofile mode that means debug mode iswhenit's not a release mode or profile modeso it's definitely a Boolean value andif it's a Boolean value we can just passan if condition like this and print itinsidenow the error is gone because we areprinting in the debug mode in releasemode we won't be able tosee the Sprint message now you might beasking hey that's fine now I understandthis but how do I run my app in releaseon profile modes to do that you cansimply go to the terminal and runflutter run dash dash release to run itand release mode but release modedoesn't work on iPhone simulatoryou can run it on an iPhone actualdeviceand same goes for profile mode youcannot run profile mode on an iOSsimulator so what I'm going to do is atthe end Maybewe'll try to run it on real devices andsee how it feels coolso now that we are done let's get backto our text button and let's improve thedesign over here first of all I wantthis text to sayconvert instead of saying click me so tochange that I can just change the textlayer and have convert save it and whenI come back over here it's convert coolnext thing I want to do ismake sure the button background is blackso to do that I'll have to use one ofthe text buttons propertiesnow let's take a look at the propertiestext button gives usit gives us on pressed which is arequired argument on that we alreadyfilled thatthen we haveon long press so what should happen whenyou long press the button what shouldhappen when you hover over the button byhovering it means when you justhave your cursor on the top of thisbutton this is especially used inweb applications because sometimes youmight want to change how yourbutton looks or how yourentire UI looks when you hover over abutton then there's on Focus changewhat happens when you change the focusthen the style that's what we areinterested in righteven for the text we had textilepropertyeven forthe hint text or label or prefixeverything had its own styleso we can focus on style over here aswell so that's what we wantlet's go ahead and put it over yourstyle which will be button style exactlywhat it requires and we can create anobject of the button style class likethisnow we have two problems here first oneis the child argument should be last inwidget Constructor invocations thatbasically means that whenever you createa new widget child cannot be over hereit has to be the ending propertyall the other properties should go abovechildand this does not have any performanceimpacts but it's just readable codebecause basically you're in a widgettree right and if you have a text buttonit's good to see the last thing overhereit's just a matter of preferences if youdon't like this you can definitely goahead and Analysis option.aml and makesure you add a lintso that you avoid this kind of warningyou can do that and the next is we haveto use a constant before button style solet's use it all right now if we do thismuch nothing really changes because wehaven't provided any properties tomaterial button Stylenow the first thing that I want to do ischange the background color of thebutton so let's get access to thebackground colorand it's not simple as it looks itdoesn't just ask for a color it asks formaterial State Property with a generictype of color which can be nullable andmaterial State Property is also nullableand that that makes sense rightif we remove background color it worksif we want to put a background colorthat also works so nullable makes senseand then if you want to pass a color youcan pass if you don't want to pass acolor you can't pass it now how do Imake sure material State Property isadded over here to do that let's creatematerial stateproperty and create an instance but if Ido that it gives me an error becauseit's an abstract classso we cannot use material State Propertyhowever we have something known asmaterial State Property all that we canusenow if I come over here you see classmaterial State Property all it requiresthe same generic type that our materialState Property requiresand it implements itso that's why we can use it inbackground colornow if you hover over this it is smartto identify that it requires a propertyor the value of a color why because yourbackground color required material StateProperty colorand when we use material State Propertyall it automaticallysaid hey use color so we have to pass ina color over here now what is mybackground color going to be wellcolors.black let's try that save it comeover here and we have a button showingup the next thing I want to do is changethe text style soto do that I can maybe try to change thetextile property over here let's goahead and try to do that we have textilethen again we'll pass material StateProperty all then we'll pass a textilesaying let's say color is colors Dotwhite maybe that looks goodthen we'll save itcome over hereand nothing really changes if I try torestart the app still nothing changesthe reason for that is if you hover overthis property it says the style for abuttons text widget descendants so weare doing the correct thingbecause buttons text widget descendantis our text over here but the color ofthe text style is typically not useddirectly the foreground color is usedinsteadso we need to use foreground color andpass that in so we can have materialState Property all then we'll passcolors dot Whitelet's remove the textile property andlet's see if that worksbecome aware and boom that works we havea nice button displaying here and maybeyou're satisfied with this UI but I'mnotbecause what I want to do is increasethe button's height and width and maybethe font size of this text as wellso let's do that first we'll focus onthe sizing so to increase the sizing wecan do sizeand it doesn't really have a sizeproperty but it does have icon sizefixed size maximum size minimum size andtap Target sizeicon size is the size of the icon insideof the button but we are not using anyicons so we can ignore that then we havefixed size so what will the fixed sizeof the button be irrespective of whatscreen size we are on if we are on asmaller device or we are on a biggerdevice the size will remain the same solet's go ahead with fixed sizeand that requires again material StateProperty alland then we need to pass in somethingknown as a sizeis size a class is size an enum what isit well size is a class it already givesus an auto suggestion if I tap over itit gives metwo things to password width and heightto pass a widthmaybe I can say 200 that should beenough and height will be 50. now if Isave it come away my buttonsheight and width both have increased butI'm not satisfied with how much thewidth increased I wanted to take theentire space just like the text fielddidso maybe I can passthe width as 300.then maybe we can try 350.still not enough so we can go ahead with400 and that's enough but that's not allmaybe we have to do 410and that's enoughbut what will happen if I use a smalleror a bigger deviceor if we just take a different devicealtogether what will happen will thething be the same so let's go ahead andtry it I'm just going to call my pixel 6emulator you can just call it like thisyou know just click over here start thepixel 6 emulator from here you don'thave to go to Android Studio to start itnowafter this device is selected I canclick on run run without debugging oryou can start debugging whatever youwantI'll run without debugging press commandJ go to the debug consoleyou see we have a bunch of Errors overhere but that's related to whenwe put a textile property for thisbutton Styleand then you see we have reloaded whichis hot reload when we save it hotReloadedbut anyways I don't want to focus oniPhone emulator now I'll just change thedevice and focus from iPhone to pixeland now I'll see all thewarningsproperties calls related to my Androidemulator okay and we see that it hasstarted if we come over herethere we go we have our app right herebut that's the problem when we are 400on a different device size it looksproper but on an Android emulator itlooks different and if you open web itmight look differenton a smaller device we might even get anerror whybecause let's say I put 450 over herebecause I want to cover the entire sizeso this is what fixed size means nomatter what the device size is no matterwhat the device screen isthis is going to be the size and itworks fine you knowit works well the problem here isn'tabout the fixed size property or anyproperty that we are using it's aboutthe fixed value of the width that weneed to give is there no way such that Ican give maximum value to the width howmuch ever it requires it can takewell there is a property to do so wehave doubleyou know this doubledot Infinityso if we click command click on doublewe'll go into the dot implementation ofdoubleand double is an abstract class as wellbut we are not instantiating the doubleClause we are not doing double like thisinstead we are calling the staticproperty of Infinity on it and infinityis one one divided by 0. so it'sbasically saying that take maximumamount of space possible and if I saveon it right now and put commascome over herewe get back our normal buttonbecause that's the maximum amount ofspeeds this button is taking in fixedsize property but what will happen if Iuse minimum size minimum sizes that thatyou need to take at least this much sizeon whatever device you're on and if Isave it there we go on both the screensour buttons are looking similar becausethey are taking the maximum amount ofspace possibleand what will happen if I do maximumsize and save it we'll get back to ournormal buttonbecause what what it's saying isthe maximum size of this button shouldbe double dot infinity and 50. but ifyou can have this value you should takeitbut in themaximum screen device this is what thebutton should havebut anyways we are going to go aheadwith minimum size because that's what wewant we want it to extend till theentire end of the screen now you mightask hey this doesn't look good I wantthere to be this spacingand we are going to tackle that the sameway we tackled our text field we aregoing to wrap it with the padding widgetso we are going to come to the textbutton press command shift rthen wrap it with a padding widget andhave Edge and such dot all 10.0 andthere we go on both the device screenswe have similar spacing perfectnow you might have a question why do Ihave to wrap it with a padding widgetwhy can't I do something like double dotInfinity minus let's say 40 becausehere from the left hand right side youhave 10 10 so not 40 double dot Infinityminus 20 and then save it the reason forthat is double dot Infinity isn't avaluethat you cancount it is infinityit is an infinite value and you'resaying that minimum size should be thisdouble dot Infinity is saying that youcan take as much size as possible on thescreenand then if you do double dot Infinityminus 20using Infinity minus 20 which is stillInfinityso it doesn't have any effect over herethat's why you have to use the paddingalso there is no other button styleproperty that will help you to removespacing from hereeither you'll have to setproper constraints but that will differon every screen sizeor you'll have tomake a way like using a padding widgetusing double dot infinity and all ofthat stuffso let's put a padding 10 againand this looks good on all the screensizes perfectnow this is what text looks likewhat will elevated look like then sothis is what the text button looks likewhat will the raised button appear likeso to configure that we can just goahead andinstead of text button havesomething known as elevated button andyou see we don't get any errors becauseit requires the exact same things onpressed as a required property child isa required property and the same styleis required all the properties are sameon pressed on long press on Hover butwhat changes is the design yearyou might say hey there's no differenceI cannot see anything but there it isthis button right here is raised alittle bit what I'm going to do is putthis in a side by side view so that youunderstand this betterlet's come over herelet's get back to text button save itand you'll see some sort of elevation isgoneif I save it againsome kind of elevation is thereelevation is added by putting some sortof background behind it there's somekind of Shadow to itto show this elevation I'm just going togo ahead and Pass elevation 15and elevation doesn't require double itrequires material State Property doubleso let's go ahead and pass materialState Property all15 like this save it and you see there'smore Shadow behind so it appears moreelevated it gives a more you can say 3Dview it's not exactly 3D but it gives amore3D kind of effectthat's what elevated button does and bydefault it has its own elevation Setterbut text button does not have anyelevation setso it's kind of like a simple flatbutton and the fun fact iselevated button was previously called asraised button and text button was knownas flat buttonbecause elevated button was erased andflat and text button was flatbut then they decided to change it inlater versions of flutter so I hope youunderstood the difference between thesetwo type of buttons now you canobviously go ahead and configure more inthese buttons for example you can setthe shape let's go ahead and set one sowe have shape and that also requiresmaterial State Property alland then requires outlined border solet's go ahead and pass outlined borderbut there's nothing likeoutlined border like this because it isan abstract class so again we need tofind something that extends outlineborder so for this we have multipletypeslet's go ahead with the one I know ovalborder you seeas the name suggests it will be able tocreate an oval border also if you presscommand and go into the source code itover border extends Circle border whichis another border you can also useCircle Border in your code if you justgo here and use Circle border that willbe finebut at the end of the day Circle borderalso extends outlined border so ovalborder extends outline border all rightnow if I save it come over here this isa buttonlooks kind of weird then we also havethe circle border you can try thatthenthis kind of Border will look better ona button that requires an icon in ourcase we don't require an icon we justrequire a textbut what I'm seeing is this might looksomething like this you can have an iconover here which will be icons dot let'ssay convert that's nothing like that somaybeicons Dot money just to demonstrate yousee this looks good enough and when youadd elevated button on top of it thiswill look much betterall right so this is what Circle bordercan be used with oval border might bethere to create somedifferent UI style I don't know whyanyone would use oval border to behonest in a production ready app thatneeds seriousattention all rightthen the other border that we have isrectangle borderso we havethree types of rectangle border beveledrectangle border rounded rectangleborder and contain as rectangle borderlet's go ahead with the roundedrectangular border save it come overhere and we have a button looking theway we wanted it to now we can make someadvancements here because it requiresBorder Side border radius everythingthat we've seen before you can configureover hereand all of that is named argumentsfor example you can just go ahead andmention border radius then you haveborder radius Dotcircular10 also remove constant here because aswe know border radius dot circular isn'ta constant put constant for everythingso let's go ahead and put itsave it come over here and you see thiskind of design and this actually looksgood I'm happy with thisthen we also have beveled rectangleborder it also has a border radiusproperty but we are just going to skipthat save itthe difference here is this is pointyinstead of havingarcsin the edges over hereand the last one is continuous rectangleborder let's save it if you want you canjust go ahead using beveld rectangleboard not be weld sorry roundedrectangle border and it will give you agood enough designnow if you want to reduce theborder radius you can do that also let'sput some formatting in placeby putting some commas and this looksgood I'm satisfied so yeah this workswell also I'm just going to keep thetext button I'm not going to useelevated button now let's remove all thecomments and yeah this looks goodnow you might see that they're spacinghere between this button and this textfield already that's there because ofthe padding property added here here wehave added a padding property sayingEdge and such dot all 10. so from allthe sides there is a padding of 10 fromthe top from left from right and fromthe bottomthat's why they're spacing over hereso we are done with the UI but still youmight be not convinced by what the stylerequires right because every single timewe have to pass in material StateProperty all then mention the color ormaterial state property or then mentionthe size material State Property allthen mention the shape or the Bordernow that is a lot of tasks to do soinstead of doing that we have analternative what we can do isis do text button Dot and we have anoption of text button dot style fromby using text button dot style from wedon't have to mention material StateProperty all for everything you directlyget options to color shapeminimum size fixed size maximum size allof those things so you can just go aheadand use text button.style from but sinceI'm lazy to type it all again I'm goingto undo everything I didcopy this line right here press commandshift Z to redo everything so that Icome back to text button dot style fromand I'll just paste everything backnow I can remove all the material StateProperty alls from hereand just put the requiredcolors and sizes all rightso that will work as wellbut make sure you do it nicely otherwiseyou might get confused with the bracketsand willmiss one of the bracketsalso put a const here because sizerequires thatand text button dot style from doesn'tgive us constant thing because it is afunction functions cannot be constantrightnow if we save it like thiscome over herewe have a text button showing as it isas it was before no changes but insteadof havingmaterial State Property all foreverything we have our simple colors andsizes passed cool so I hope you'reconvinced by this also if you haveelevated button you can go ahead and useelevated button dot style from and itwon't stop you you'll be able to do allthe stuff great so we have a functioningUI now this is all that was required forour simple currency converter appcongratulations on being done with theuser interface we have learned quite alot even if you think it's a smalloutputso you can leave the user interface atthis this looks decent enoughbut if you want to add something there'sone element you can add which is an appbar an app bar is the header thing thatwe see right at the top you can add thatso let's go to our scaffoldit is not included in body right becauseit's a header why will header stuff beincluded inside of a bodyheader is included inside of a scaffoldthere is an app bar so you can go aheadand pass an ABBA an app bar requiressomething known as a preferred sizewidget but yeah you can go ahead andPass App barrier why because app barextendsor implements a preferred sized widgetand preferred size widget implements awidget all right and if you seepreferred size widgetis an abstract class which just has onegetter inside of thisget preferred sizeand app bar implements thatsave it and you see our entire userinterface is looking quite differentthat's because by default the app barhas a color of blueand that is something related to themingwhich we'll get to when we build oursecond applicationbut as of now we don't want this to beblue or anything we just want it to takethe same color as this background colorso to do that we can change thebackground color and set it equal tocolors.blue gray exactly what thescaffolds background color isbut still we have this sort of elevationhere so we can remove this elevation bysetting the elevation property of theapp bar to zero and once we do that theapp bar is gone now you'll ask heywhat's the purpose of adding an ABBA ifyou just wanted to erase it the reasonfor that is at the top I just want tomentioncurrency converterso an app bar requires some sort oftitle and here we have a title itrequires some sort of text right titleis a perfect choice for itso we'll passtitle here and it the title requires awidget so you can just pass in a textwidget and saycurrencyconverter also put a constable here saveit come back and we have currencyconverter displaythis is our app bar title in Android itshows up on the left hand side in iOS itis right in the centerso you can use either of them if youstrictly want to Center the title youcan go ahead and set the property ofCenter title to true and if you do thatit is centered in both the places and ifyou set to false it will be aligned inthe left hand side for both of thesedevices also if you want to change thecolor of this textile you can change itby passing in a style textile what wehave already seen before color colorsdot black all right now if we come wehave currency converter displaying likethis but I don't like how it looks withthe style so I'm just going to keep itlike this goodAbba also has multiple other optionslike if you want to increase the sizeyou can add a bottom preferred sizewidget so that can be an app bar againand you'll be able to have two app barsthen we have actions which requires alist of widget now what is actionsactions isa bunch ofbuttons or a bunch of widgets that youcan show in the right hand side cornerover hereso we can have actions like this andlet's say you want to display a texthere saying hellosave it and you can show hello there nowthis actions usually contains icons andstuff so that you know if you want toexit the app or do anything else you canuse that using actions actions is notused for displaying textnow if you take an example of WhatsAppWhatsApp has abunch ofactions so it has the video calling iconthe phonecall icon and the more options I can allof those areactions then we also have leading thisis also particularly icon or if you wantto display an image but it's generallynot for textwhat leading does is shows some widgetover here and it only requires onewidget actions can have a list ofwidgets just like a column butthey are displayed in a horizontalManner and leading only requires onewidgetnow we'll get to all these propertieslater on when we build our shopping appbut for now we don't need to get into itand I'm also satisfied with the currencyconverter app that we have till now nowlet's figure out how can I make sure myapp functions right so when I'vementioned the USD let's say 1.0 to 8and click on convert I want to convertto INR now how can I do thatthis sounds very easy all we need to dois first step is create a variablethat stores the convertedcurrency valueso right now we have the zero theinitial value of the variable is goingto be 0 then whenever we pass somethinglike 1.08 to it click on convert we'llmultiply 1.08 to the standard exchangerate that we have let's say 81 becauseone USD is 81 so we'll multiply 1.08with 81 and whatever answer we'll getwe'll store in that variableso we the second step is just going tobe to create a function that multipliesthe value given bythe text fieldwith 81 or whatever exchange rate youhave maybe you're not converting fromUSD to INR you're converting to someother value you can use that value not81.then the third step isto store the valuein the variable that we createdright so we created a function thatmultiplies the value with 81 then we arejust touring the value in this variablethat we created and thenwe only have to display that variablesounds easy doesn't itso let's try to do this in our statelesswidget so let's go ahead and do ourfirst step create a variable that storesthe converted currency value and alsowhat I'm going to do is copy all of thisand paste it outside of the class thatwe have I'm not going to keep it insidebecause it just obstructs my view andwill make it difficult for menow what I'm going to do is go ahead andcreate a variable inside of this classso I can just go ahead and create avariable and result is equal to 0.but then we get an error saying thisclass or a class that this classinherits from is marked as immutable whybecause we are extending a statelesswidget right and I told you in thebeginning of theflutter section that the statelesswidgetis immutableany Fields inside of it cannot changeand here we are allowing it to changebecause it is not a constant or it isnot a final if we put Final End Resultover here the error will get resolvedbut if we just put end result that meansthis value can be reassigned this is amutable variable and it cannot bepresent inside a stateless widgetso what can we do if we put final wewon't be able to change the value so itdoesn't make sense to make it finalhowever what we can do is put it insideof the build function right if we put itand result is equal to 0it will work fine because this is afunction and function you can change thevalue but inside a class a globalvariable you cannot changethe value if it's immutable so endresult is equal to 0 is fine in thisfunctionnow what I want to do istake this valuefrom the text fieldand multiply it by 81 whenever the userclicks on convertnow how do I get the value from the textfieldif I come over here does text field haveany of the properties not really if youuse on submitted which is one of thefunctions text field providesyou'll see we get a valueand if we try to print the valueI'm just printing it not debug printingit because I'm going to remove this lineand open the debug consolecome over here and let's say I type 1.2convertbutton click comeson submitted is not triggered at allbecause on submitted is triggered whenwe click on return button from ourkeyboard once I click on enter from thekeyboard we get 1.2 so this on submittedgets triggered when the text field issubmitted and that's not the layout ofour appif the user clicks on return that's fineor even then we can do something butwhen the user clicks on convert which isanother button that we've given themthen also it needs to get triggeredso we cannot use the on submittedpropertythen what can we use such that whatevervalue is present inside the text fieldcan come to this elevated buttonmeaning we want to get a valueprovided by the text field or the userinput which is given to the text fieldthat is available throughout our entireclass because if elevated button canaccess it any widget can access it rightso for that again we might have tocreate something in the build functionor you can do that in the statelesswidget itselfwhat we need to create isa text editing controller so we'll goahead and have text editing controllerand you're just going to name it textediting controller which is equal totext editing controllernow again we get the same errors that wedid before but this time there's goingto be a change we are going to call thisfinal text editing controller but assoon as you put final aware you seewe still have an error can't define thecons Constructor because the field textediting Constructor is initialized withthe non-constant valuewe get this error because text editingcontroller if we click and go to thesource codeis not a constant Constructorso we'll have to remove constant fromherethat means we'll have to remove constantfrom the material app and as I've toldyou multiple times before it will nothelp in boosting the performance of ourapp and I tell you why when we get intoanother type of widgetin a few minutesso again in this text editing controllerneeds to be shifted at the top we canput the constant backand the constant is here as well greatnow why is this text editing controllerconstant because text editingcontroller's value is not going to bechangedwe just have to take this valueand paste it inside of our text editingtext field you see we have a controllerproperty we can pass it over there so wepass thattext editing controller paste it andthere we gonow through this text editing controllerwill have access toall the user inputs so if we come overhere in elevated button let's remove allof this and we'll print text editingcontroller if we just print that we'llget something like instance of textediting controller because text editingcontroller is a class right howeverlet's try thisI'm also going to go ahead and restartthe appI'll enter the amount so let's say 1.5convertand we get text editing controller andyeah we are able to see all of theproperties inside of itso we have text editing value with thetextand the text is 1.5 which is correctthen the selection is there then textAffinity is therecomposing is there and all of that stuffwhat we care about is textso we are just going to access that sowe are going to have text ratingcontroller Dot and we see we have textwe can use thatso this will give us the text that werequire now we'll come here againpress 1.7 convertCtrl J and we have 1.7 so it correctlygives us the rightanswer in the elevated button that'sgood now what I want to do is printtext editingcontroller Dot text into81 let's say that's the current exchangerate from USD to INRit's a rough value obviously but let'sgo ahead with this let's restart our appcome over here we are going to type 2.5convertand here we see 2.5 to 0.52.52so this is not what we want why is thatthe case this is the case because textediting controller.txt gives us a stringand we have already seen in the dotcourse thatstring into an integer will multiplythe string that many times so we have2.5 2.5 2.5 written out 81 times it'snot actually multiplying but it's justconcatenating adding the stringstogetherso what we need to do is convert thisintegeror convert the string into an integerand then multiply it with 81. so we canhave end dot parse and actuallywe cannot have just in dot pass whybecause n dot parse guarantees us thatwe'll get only an integer but what if adouble is mentioned over here like 2.5so we'll have to make this double dotpassand then wrap our texteditingcontroller.txt like thisso what double dot pass does is convertthe string into a double and integer dotparse converts the string into aninteger okayso let's try to do this press command Jcome back over here let's type in 2.5again click on convert and we have 202.5which is correct 81 into 2.5 is 202.5perfectso that means you are getting a valuenow we just need to store this valueinside of our result variable so let'sget rid of themwe are just going to go ahead and typeresult is equal todouble dot passtext editingcontroller Dot textinto81 but now if you see this we get anerror why becausea value of type double cannot beassigned to a variablethe variable of type integerand that's because the result is aninteger and this is converted to adouble and double into an integer willgive you a doubleso you'll go ahead and change result toa double correctsave it come over here andwe have successfully changed the resultnow if we see this we should be seeing2.5 convert and this text isn't changingwhyand we are no longer getting the printstatement we are not getting the printstatement because we have removed theprint statement from on pressed but weshould be seeing the change in textright not exactly because in text if wego we still have a hard coded 0mentioned over herehard-coded 0 is not what we want we wantresult to be mentioned over here so wecan go ahead and pass resultand now we get an error saying argumenttype double cannot be assigned toparameter type string because textrequires a string and result is a doubleso what you can do isresult Dot tostring and that willconvert text toa string rightso to summarize to convert from intostringyou have to dothe integer valuedot to string anything you want toconvert to a string you just call thetostring method on it because that'spresent on almost every objectand if you want toconvert from string to int or double youdo string valueand wrap it with n dot parse or doubledot pass all rightlet's see with this but you're stillgetting an error arguments of a constantcreation must be constant Expressionsthe reason for that is this resultvariable is changing rightthis is a mutable variable it'simmutable aware and it's mutable becauseof thatso it's saying that hey result ismutable so this text cannot be aconstantcan itso we'll have to remove this constantwe'll have to put constant textilesave itandwe still have a warning over here youcan see it over here so let's go at thetop and see we have this warning whichsays unused importbasically saying that this line you haveimported but itisn't in use in your codeso we can just remove this save it let'srestart the entire app and Hopethat this works so we'll go ahead firstof all we can see the change 0.0 becausethis is a result double value double toa string will give you a string like 0.0then we'll enter the amount in USD let'ssay 4.5convertand nothing changes inside over here whyif we press command Jthere's no error as well it should bechanging rightnot exactly because right now whatyou've done is created a result variableyou'vechanged the result variable over herebut you've nottold this function to rebuild so theresult value has its own newvalue all right there's no disagreeingwith that the result has a new valuebut this function is not rebuilt againif this function is not rebuilt againwe don't see the changes over herejust think about it we have a resultvariable at the top then you change thevalue so the value has changed now whatthat's the end of the function that'sthe end of everything now what shouldthe function doexactly the function has nothing left todoand it doesn't automatically see the newvalue compare the new value and displayitso we need to make sure that we callthis build function again so how do wecall this do we go ahead and call buildlike thisand hope that works so let's go aheadand try it so we are going to haveplease enter the amount in USD we aregoing to have 2.5 click on convert andstill nothing changes it's just notcalling the build function again let'sgo ahead and try it so in our buildfunction what I'm going to do is printrebuild all right so right at the top ofthis function whenever this functiongets called we're going to go ahead andcall the rebuild functionso that will let us know if thisfunction is being rebuilt so at firstthis function is getting rebuilt rightbecause as soon as we extend thestateless Widget the build function isthe first thing that is calledwhen you instantiate this now the firstthing the Constructor gets called Firstand after that the build function iscalledand the build function is calledautomatically that's why we get therebuilt firstbut then when I put the value let's say2.5 click on convert the rebuild is now2 that means this is getting rebuilt sowhy are we not seeing the output we arenot able to see the output becausethis function runs again and as a resultdouble result is equal to 0 so it getsre-initialized to zero the text editingcontroller is now remade and everythingelse is also rebuilt so the entire thingis rebuilt as a resultthe result is still zero we are not ableto see the changesso what should we do toget rid of this error maybe try creatinga global variable try creating itoutside of this class so I'll just havedouble result is equal to 0 like thisand maybe that works so let's restartthe app and have 2.5 click on convertand we are still not able to see theanswerpress command J there's no errorthere's still two rebuildsso this doesn't workso let's get back to normal andjust don't ever try to create Globalvariables unless it's really requiredbecause Global variables are badI've already mentioned why in the dotsectionits value can be changed from any classany function and if you have like 20 fora smallapplication 20 classes you will be ableto change results from everywhere andthat's not a good thing because youmight get confused at some point andchange the valueanyways now what should we do to resolvethiswell the main reason for all of this isstateless Widget the build function isnot meant for any initializations liketheseit's all fault of the stateless widgetand it's not exactly a forward ofstateless widget as well it's a fault ofus because we know stateless widgetsshould not have any state and we arestill having states of air I did so muchso that I could explain you whythe stateless widget is immutableand why you cannot change any of theoutput on the screenin a stateless widget so what is thething we should do to resolve this wellextend it to a stateful widget as simpleas that so I'm just going to create anew class so that we see the differencebetween a stateless and a statefulwidget so we have a class currencyconverter materialpage and I'm going to call this page Gall right now we have the error inmain.dot file but we don't care about itas of nowI've just renamed this class to PGso that I can create a stateful widgetwith the name currency convertermaterial page now I'm just going to goahead and extend a stateful widgetnow as soon as I do this I again geterrors because it requires methods whatis the method is it the build functionno it just requires one thing statefulwidget dot create stateso we need to implementa create State functionif we go in stateful widgetand scroll down we have state createstate that is what we want to do so weare going to have state create State andthen we want to return a state now whatis the state can we just return a statelike this no because state is anabstract class and in this abstractclass we have the widget property wehave our build context we havesomething known as mounted but if wescroll way down you will also seea very familiar thing hereand that is the build functionso that means we have to go ahead andcreate our own class that will extendthe state classbecause then we'll have a format that issimilar to this thing right over herebecause we'll have access to buildfunctionso now we are going to go ahead andcreate a class and I'm going to callthis currencyconvertermaterial page State and that is going toextend stateand see here how what I have done I'vemarked this as private class why becauseI don't want this class to be accessibleoutside of this fileonly this class should be accessibleoutside this class should not be and nowI can copy this paste it inside and ourerrors go away because I'm returning astraight right if we extend State classand return this currency convertermaterial statewe are returning a state I hope thatmakes sense we still have warnings butwe'll resolve them later onnow what it requires is a concreteimplementation of state DOT bill andit's the exact same thing as this thingso you can haveeither it override widget dot build andthen we can return let's say a constantscaffoldso we have basically two classes overherefirst one is currency converter materialpage that extends a stateful widgetand as a result we have to create thecreate State method and here it requiresa state but we cannot create an instanceof the state class becauseit is an abstract lossand the abstract class is basicallysaying that heyjust extend this get the build functionand then write your entire apps codeover herenow you might ask what is the purpose ofthese two separate classesthe reason for that is here we create astate and what state does is veryinteresting the state will allow us tocreate our variables will allow us tocreate our functions and alsoeverything inside of this class can beIM can be mutable so I can go ahead andtype double result is equal to 0 andthat doesn't give me a warning or anerrorit's all good inside of thisbut here if I try to go ahead and createdouble result is equal to zero we havean error this class is marked asimmutablebecause stateful widgethas a constant Constructor but statedoesn't have that it's an abstract classthat allowsso we just need to extend State and thatdoes a worknow we have understood the structure ofa stateless widget and I hope you areunderstanding what I'm doingagain if you want a brief and you havesome questions let's go along the codewe have a class that extends a statefulwidget then we have create Statefunction that creates the statebut thenwe cannotinstantiate State class aware so what weneed to do is create our own state thatextends the state class and as a resultwe can put that over here inheritanceconceptthen we need to override the buildfunction and here it's the exact samething as this thing you can create yourown stuffthe reason there are two differentclasses is because you cannot createmutable variables inside of this classso that you know we still have aConstructor that is constant but you cango ahead and create your own mutablevariables here because this does nothave a constant Constructorand this is a private thing because itshould be accessible only for thisclass so that we could create a state itshould not be accessible outside of thisfileleave outside of this file it should notbe accessible outside of this class alsobutthat's how private variables work in dotwe've talked about this in the dotcourseso we'll have to live with thisnow let's resolve the warnings the firstwarning that we have is Constructors forpublic widgets should have a keyparameter so just like this we have tocreatea constant Constructor so we havecurrency converter material page superdot key inside of a named argument saveit then we have creates date and it saysthe member create States override aninherited member but isn't annotatedwith override so basically since this isthere because of stateful widget we haveto put add the rate overridejust like we did with the build functionright and there we go we have created itnow there are still some things you cando if you want to improve for exampleState takes a generic type of a t thatextends stateful widget so you can havea generic type over here and it shouldbe a stateful widget so you can go aheadand pass currency converter materialpagebut then we get an error over heresaying the currency converter materialpagecan't be returned from the method createState because it has a return type ofState currency converter material pagebut you'll say hey that's the same thinghappening over here right not reallybecause here extend State we also haveto put the generic type again which iscurrency converter material page as soonas we do that we get the errors resolvedbasically since you have not typedanything over here in the Tit wasn't able to identify that thesetwo things are of the sameclass and their stateful widget is thesame currency converter material pagebut it's still an improvement and if youdon't put it it's fineand if you put it it's betterawesomeso now what I'm going to do is show youthe difference between the stateless andthe stateful widget in stateless widgetwe just add a Constructor and then weadd the override here we have aConstructor we have create state thatcreates our class over herethen we have our override build functionand then a scaffoldnow the statejust doesn't do this it gives us accessto multiple more methods if you presscommand and go inside of it we getaccess to a getter called widget we alsohave access to build contextso yeah you can use context over hereit's accessiblehere the build context was accessibleonly inside the build function but theircontext is accessible even inside ofthis statethen we have access to mounted which welook at in a whileNH statethis is one important method that we'llgo into take a look at later on then wehave did update widget another importantthing reassemblethen set State a very very importantthing that we are going to take a lookat in thisapp itself thenwe have deactivate and we have activateand then we have dispose another veryimportant thingso it has access to methods like thiswhich will give us more capabilitiesinside of our stateful widget withstateful Widget with stateless widgetsorry you don't have access to any ofthose thingsokay anywaysnow what I want to show you iswhat all things get called over here soI'm just going to remove thiswe have our currency converter materialpage only or actually press command Zlet's copy the entire build function sothat we don't have to rewrite all thedesign that we created let's put it overherelet's get rid of the class now okay sobuild function has this thing we don'thave to type it againnow we have rebuilt over hereokay inside of the build function I'mjust going to call this build functionthen I'm going to callcreate state I'm going to convert thisto a block this is not an arrow functionanymore it's a block and we are going toreturncurrency converter material page Statefrom here but I'm also going to printcreate statethen we are going to have ourConstructor and I'm going to haveprintConstructorand then it says constant Constructorscannot have a body so let's removeconstant for now only for now we'll putit back but I just want to show what allthings get called okaynow we'll press command J we'll restartour entire app then we have Constructorthe first thing that gets called is thisthing then create state which is thisthing and then we have build functionbut what if you have certain tasks thatneed to be done before the buildfunction but are accessible only insideof this classI mean let's say you've created avariable double resultbut you're not getting the value overhere it's a late value maybe you call anasynchronous function andyou're getting the value after let's saytwo secondshow do you make sure that you get itbefore the build function is calledbecause you need to display it right youneed to display it over here so for thatreason we have a method given by ourstate class which is init stateall rightso as soon as we type in it itautocompletes it for us but if you wantto know the syntax it's just at the rateoverride because it's coming from thestate that we are extending then weavoid init statea functionthen we can remove two to implement inits statethen we call super.net state which callsthe init state of the parent class andwe've already seen this this thing isour state class all right let's go atthe top to seethis thing right here this is the stateclassso it calls the energy State of theState class and does whatever it needsto do for example the state life cyclecreatednow what is the state life cycle whatI'm showing you right now is widgetState life cycle of a stateful widgetthat means what all stuff gets calledwhat all stuffexecutes whenso when doesin its state get executedwe'll just put print rebuilt over heresave itand come over here let's restart the appand we have Constructor create Staterebuiltbuild functionso Constructor is called create statebut now instead of build function wehave the rebuilt being called init stateso NH state is what gets executedright before the build functionso if you want to assign any values thatare coming from let's say some futuresor streams you can do it in any statebut for simple initializations like oursdouble result is equal to zeroyou can put it over here like thisso let's get rid of themand let's convert everything back tonormalso let's have something like this donewe have an arrow functionwe have a Constructor and this is aconstant even in the main function thenor a main file we have to put constthreeso we have got double result over herelet's remove that save it restart comeover hereand let's put text editing controlleroutside of this build function whybecause build function should always beas less expensive as it can be whyshould the build function beless expensive because build functioncan potentially be called in every framebecause of a function that we call allrightthere's a function that will trigger therebuild of this build function so thisfunction can potentially be called inevery frames so if you have a phone thathas a refresh rate of 120 hertzyour build function can be called 120times in one secondand if it is called that many timesthat means your build function needs tobe less expensive it cannot have anyasynchronous tasks first of allof that needs to be done in the currencyconverter material page statenot in the build function becauseasynchronous task can take like one twoseconds and in one second you have tocall 120 times if it is doneso if it is called 120 times per secondyou have like 8 milliseconds to run allof the build functions or or the stuffinside of this buildfunction because one second is thousandmillisecond and it can be called 120times so 1000 divided by 120 which is 8millisecondsso it's always good to keep this methodas efficient as possible so you don'thave to put any asynchronous tasksyou don't have to doanything that will be expensive thisthing over here is not expensive you'rejust assigning a variable which doeshardly anythingyou can also push this right at the topbut since it is UI related I like tokeep it inside of the build functiononlyand if you don'treturn a result in the given time frameit can result in frame drops so it cancause UI stuttering and will cause lagsin your UI which is not a good thingfor the user experience so always keepthis build function as simple aspossible and here it's quite simpleanyways we have our result now and wehave changed the value but stilllet's remove build context from here thething is the samewe have our variable created herethen we haveresult is equal to double dot parse into81and we are not triggering the buildfunction rebuildso what should we do thenwell we can go ahead and call the buildfunction like we did and let's see whatit does let's restart Also let's printrebuilt aware that looks kind ofinterestingcome over here and we have 2.5 convertnothing happensbecause in the build function you don'thave to callre uh build function againright this is not the good way of doingitwhat you can do instead is call afunction that is provided by state andwe've looked at it before in the stateclass as source code which was suchState I told you that this is a veryimportant function right so what youneed to do is search date and itrequires you to put in a function voidfunction function so you have thisAnonymous function here and then you canpass this thing right yeahnow if you restartand I don't know why but I removedrebuilt print statement so let's putrebuild againpress command J restart the app and nowif I put 2.5 click on convert yes we seethe output 202.5and it was rebuiltwhy that's what such doeswhat set state does is set the state ifyou dive into the source code you won'tbe able to understand anything but hereat the end there's one thing element dotmarks need Mark needs buildbasically saying that it's tellingthe widget tree not widget treesomething known as Elementary but we'llget to it after the second appbut it's just telling that hey thiswidget needs a rebuild but that doesn'tmean it will start rebuilding thisentire class again noit will only build this build functiononly this function gets called again andnecessary widgets are rebuiltnowthe set States function doesn't doanything okay if you want you can justput it here like this and it will workthe same way all right so if you have2.5 it will still work the same way thisfunction is given to you so that it is aconvenience for you to put everythingthat needs a rebuild inside of herehowever what set state does is just tellthe widget tree or the elementary willget to itthat this particular thing needs arebuild so build the build functionagain and only build the necessarywidgets you see it notifies theframework that the internal state ofthis object has changed the internalstate of our object is the resultvariable that we createdand whenever you change the internalstate of a state objectwe did change the internal State of theState object via our state and this wasour object we change the value so wecall such statealso this function that we have cannotreturn a future it cannot beasynchronousand then you can read all of this thingif you want to and gain extra knowledgebut as of now what's important is thatthis calls build function only that'swhat it does triggers a rebuildusing the build functionperfect so we've converted our currencyfrom USD to INRnow if I change it to 80 and restart myentire app let's say I put 2.5 thisgives me 200 great if I put 2 click onconvert 160 if I put 150 convert I get12 000.and if you want to do something extrawhat you can do is put INR over here butwe have to encapsulate everything in astringso we'll just have dollar resultdot two stringbut I've already mentioned it to you ifyou have result.2 string inside ofstring interpolation we can skipresult.2 string and we can just have INRdollar resultand now we have INR 12000 if you want toput a Rupee symbol or your currency thatyou've converted you can put thatso that marks the end of our currencyconverter material appnow let's take a look at what Cupertinoapp looks like I hope you are familiarwith all the code that we have writtentill now we have gone through a lotwe've gone through stateless widgetstateful widget the state set State NHState we are going to dive into sets inits state and all of that set state isalmost required everywhereso we'll keep using that and we'll keepbrushing our concept I hope you alsounderstood the purpose of text editingcontroller text editing controller givesus access to text in the entire widgetwherever we wantand last thing that I'd like to mentionis the on press function over heresince this is a function that requires atype of void function like this you cango ahead and createa function over here so let's copy itand have void convertand paste this over here also remove thebrackets this thing right here convertnow you can go downand pass it to on pressed so you caneither do it this way convert like thisoryou can just pass convert like thisdon't call it like this you have to callit like this why because convert has afunction type of void function just likethis requires so it's a tear offfunctionsince both of them match in what theyrequire void function and this is alsothe same thingyou can just pass it like this howeverwhen you call it thisit means you're calling the function andyou don't have to call the function inon press because when you call it youreturn a type of voidand void cannot be assigned to onpressedso that's why you just have to putconvert over here and that will work aswell such state is accessible throughoutour currency converter material pageState and widgets are always immutablethe state makes this class mutable sothere is no performanceimpact on our widgetthis is still a constant but this isn'tso we have mutable stuff over here andthat is why we have two classes manypeople don't understand this but I hopeyou've understood this also let's removecolor from here and we have our appready so we have a currency convertermaterial page ready there's still a lotof stuff you can do there is a lot ofedge cases that you can handle forexamplea UI changejust take a look at this you have apadding over here which has agencies.all10 then you have a padding over herewhich has agencies.all 10 so what youcan do instead is just wrap this entirecolumn with a padding widget instead ofwrapping all of the widgets separatelyin a padding widgetso what you can do isselect this copy press Ctrl shiftrto open the refactoring option removethis Widget the same goes over here Ctrlshift R remove the switcher then you canwrap the entire columnby doing comma Ctrl shift R wrapping itwitha padding widget and pasting ouragencies.all 10 over hereand once we do thatwe have spacing left from here but allthe spacing beneath it is gone so weneed to add thatso do you mean I have to put text fieldagain in a padding widget no then whatis the sense of making padding widgetover here no what you can do is use acontainer right by container you canmention a height let's say you want toleave a height of 10. then the samething you can save it and you have yourheight left outbut here's the problem this containerdoesn't have a constantConstructorand as a resultwhen I have to rebuild this containerwill also get rebuilt unnecessarilythat's what constant doeswhenever your function is going to getrebuilt your widgets will also getrebuilt what constant sees itis this doesn't need a rebuild becausethis is a constant if you have aconstant it will not read need a rebuildbut container doesn't have thatand it will be unnecessarily rebuiltbecausewe just have to leave a space we justneed to leave a height why can't it be aconstant then that's why we have accessto constant sized box size box helps usleave a space you know container is aall-in-one widget it will help you toadd height width padding margin colorbut what size work does is just help youleave width heightand it has a constant Constructor soinstead of using container everywhereyou can use a size box it doesn't haveany difference in the UI but it doeshave a difference in performance nowit's a very very small impactbut it still has an impactso let's try to make our apps asefficient as possible so with this wedon't have to wrap any other widgetsthat we'll add inside of the widget treewith a padding widget all of them willhave their automatic padding and noweven text has a paddingso if it exceeds this length it stillhas a padding so that's great and onelast Edge case that I can see is if Iput 2.52 click on convert I have thisbut if I put multiple digits we have ourINR extending till below I don't wantthat maximum I want is let's sayone or two digit I don't want it thisprecise so what I can do iswrap this and have dot two string andyou have multiple methods for it twostring two string as exponential twostring as fixed and two string asprecisionI'll use two string as precision andpass 2 over hereand when I do that I get INR 2.0 e plus2. now this is not in the format I wantif you use calculator you know what thisis talking about if you haven't don'tcare about it I don't want it like thiswhat I want is to string as fixed Maybethen we can add 2 over here and we haveINR 201.77so it only gives me a maximum of twodigits and if you want you can givethree widget and it will work fine thenrestart and you add INR 0.0.00now if you want to avoid this wheneveryou have 0 you don't want it to extendtill 3 does itafter the decimal place what you can doisadd a ternary operator over here insideof thisstring interpolation itself what you cando is if resultis not equal to zero so if result is notequal to 0 then we want this thing rightsince our result was not 0 I wanted204.480 but since my result is not 0anymoreI'll wantresult dot 2 stringas exponentialzeroso I don't want there to be anyexponents now if I restartI get e again but that's not I wantsorry I want to string as fixedand then we can save it we come overhere we get inr0 but if I put 2.566 likethis I get three digits maximum so wehave handled the edge case over you areusing the ternary operator now you knowhow everything is coming back to itsplaces we learned everything separatelyin the dart course and now everything iscoming together you can't use an ifcondition over herebecause you know it doesn't make sensehow can you use it inside of a stringinterpolationso you can go ahead and useternary operatorgreat so this is our app for thematerial page I'm going to get done withthis now now what we are going to do isgo ahead in the lip folder and createcurrency converter Cupertinopage dot dot now you're going to have aCupertino design so let's go ahead anddesign it so the first thing to do hereis to import material.dot right notreally because when we importmaterial.dot we get all the widgetsrelated to material designlike this elevated button but we don'twant that so I'm going to go ahead andimportcupertino.dot which is similar to whatwe saw earlierall rightnow cupertino. will give us only thethings thatare following Cupertino design now wehave to go ahead and create our statefull widget now do I have to type theentire stateful widget here that can becumbersome rightjust writing all of these classesI made you type earlier so that youunderstood what was happening here butnow that we have understood it we cantype here SPF L and you see we havesomething known as a code snippetwhen we click on this we get all theboilerplate code required to create astateful widgetthis is provided by the flutter and Dotvs code extension that we added so nowwe have access to the currencyso now we have access to the state fullwidget snippet we also have access tostateless widget snippet I'll show youafter we type the name of this class nowI don't want my class name to be mywidget right so it already highlightseverything for me and all I have to dois type the name so we have currencyI made a typo we can type currencyconverter Cupertino page all right andit changes it everywhere there is sowherever it's necessary it will changeit now I can save it and there we go nowit is returning a please holder for uswe don't want that what we want isall the things that are returned overhere and then we can go ahead and changewhatever is not required so let's goahead copy thisreturn the build function because at theend of the day we need to have the samekind of layoutbut now we have many errors we'll solvethem but before that let's go ahead andcopy the logic as well all the textediting controller result and all ofthatnow we can come over here save it andthere we go the errors reduce but in noway are they lesser why because we haveintroduced cupertino.dot and outlineinput border scaffold ABBA all of themfollow the material designyou see stuff like Center padding columntext are not affected by Cupertino ormaterial design they are present in bothof them Cupertino and material becausethetypography is not decided by the textitself it is decided by what we arereturning away a material app orCupertino appand then we have column which is alayout thing padding which is basicallyjust leaving space so it doesn't have tofollow material or Cupertino designguidelines and Center is againa design guidelineand Center is againa layout widgetso now we have to go ahead and changeeverythingfirst of all I'm going to go to themain.dot file I'm going to create astateless widget here so to create astateless widget you can type St L andthen you have a snippet for statelesswidget as wellyou click on this and then it createsall the boilerplate code for a statelesswidget now you can just type myCupertino appokay then you are going to return thisexact thing but instead of material appyou're going to have Cupertino appand this also accepts a home argumentthough these two things are differentkubatino app doesn't have the same themethat it requires it requires Cupertinotheme data and this requiresjust a theme dataokay so there are differences butanyways now let's take thisput it over here we all have myCupertino App instead of my app so itwill run this class not this classso this class is basically neverexecutednow we can save thisalso we can have currency converterCupertino page instead of currencyconverter material page otherwise itmight give you some weird outputnow let's come back over here now we arereturning a scaffold scaffold isapparently a part of material or not sowhat we need to do here is returnCupertino scaffoldscaffoldallows you to createa an app bar at the top so we definitelywant Cupertino page scaffoldthen it has multiple things it doesn'thave the Abba property or the bodyproperty let's see what it requires itwants a child property so our child isgoing to be this thing which is niceand then we have navigation bar so wecan return a navigation barrierand in navigation bar it requiresobstructing preferred size widget itdoesn't require preferred size widgetanymore which is what app bar isand also app bar is from material.dot somaybe we can go ahead and type CupertinoAbba and maybe we get something but nobut if we type Cupertinonavigation barwe get that and Cupertino navigation baris exactly what we can pass over herenow gopertino navigation bar is the samething as app bar at the topso we don't need to worry about itthen it has a bunch of properties whatwe require is a title and if we comeover herewe see a widget which is middle and asyou already know in iOS Stylethe title is always always Center if itis already centeredit makes more sense to name it middle sowhat do you want in the middleso we can have middle over here sweetand if you see there's no thing aselevation over here because Cupertinowidgets don't really have any elevationsor depth to themso we can remove thisnow to resolve the colors error if wepress command full stop to get a list offixes we can apply to a project we seeimport Library package fluttermaterial.dot becausematerial.dot also includes the colorsyour app is going to haveso we cannot use the colors class but wecan go ahead and use Cupertino colorsand it gives me a bunch of colors nowI'm going to go ahead and have Cupertinocolors Dotblue then we have two type of colorssystem blue or Active blueI don't want any of those maybe Graylet's go ahead with system gate grade 3then we can save this much then we canagain copy this and the exact same thinglet's hope we like the version that itspits outAlso let's put a const over here becauseCupertino colorsare constant all rightwhy because if we come over here it isabstract final class rightso let's exit thisnow let's scroll down we have text fieldso instead of text field here what werequire is Cupertinotext field there we goas easy as it getswhatever is there in material.just putCupertino before it and it will become aCupertino widgetit has the same property of controllerbut color again we'll have to putCupertino colors dot black so that'sfineI'll copy this line again and paste itover herebut here the decoration requires boxdecorationand box decoration isnot related to input declaration so wehave to get rid of input decoration andjust pass in box decoration over herenow let's design everything that we havethe first thing we need to mention isthe border so let's go ahead and pass ina border now the Border it requires isbox border so maybe we can type in boxborder but that isn't allowedhowever if we just type border dot allit allows us to pass it in so we canjust have border.allthen we need to mention the color of ourborder and the color of our border isthe default one so we're just going toleave it at that then we also have tomention the Border radius the Borderradius is 5 so let's go ahead with thatlet's take the default one then we haveborder radiusand the Border radius is going to beborder radius dot circular five that'sgoodnow we can try to mention the color aswellso the color of the text field we wantiscolors.white so we can go ahead and passCupertino colors dot y I guess that willwork rightand that's all that we require so maybewe can just get rid of all of thiswe still need to mention hint text solet's copy it and then get rid of thisand see the decoration doesn't give usproperties to change the hint texthowever Cupertino text field does givethose properties and there we have itplaceholder we also have the prefixwidget and it doesn't have all of thoseprefix stufflike prefix icon prefix prefix style itjust has prefix which requires a widgetthat is coolso if we go ahead and type hint overhere there's no hint related stuffbutif we type placeholder and then typeplease enter the amount in USD thatshould workand then finally we need a prefix widgetwhich is I can ikins dot monitor not Ican we cannot use icon why where are theiconsis also coming from material.dot wecannot use thatso we can go ahead and type somethinglike Cupertino icons and there we haveit so we can pass in Cupertino icons Dotmoneyand it does have money dollar signexactly what I needand put a const over here perfectso this looks good now the final thingthat I need to work on is buttonelevated button is also coming fromMaterial design now you might havenoticed that everything that was UIrelated changed from material toCupertino dot dotand all the layout widgets like columnpadding Center and text because thatdepends on cupertino.settings orCupertino app settingsthat's fineso let's go ahead and instead ofelevated button we are going to useCupertino button as simple as it getsthen Cupertino button requires a childwhich we have already passed then itrequires a colorso what is the color you want so thecolor I want isblack so we are going to have Cupertinocolors dot blackthen I want something sizing related sowe have minimum sizemaybe we can look into that so we haveminimum size and that is a doublethe default is K minimum interactionDimension Cupertino let's go over thatwhenever you havesomething like K it is meant to be aconstantthat's flutter's way of saying that heythis is a constant now we can dive intothis and we have 44 showing here andthen it has design guidelines about itso I'm not going to meddle with it I'mjust going to keep it as it is and seewhat the output is if I want to changeit I can go ahead and change it rightand then maybe I can remove all of thisthe only thing that's left is to makesure the color is white andthe shape is rounded rectangle borderwith a border radius of 5. so let's getrid of itand almost all our errors are done let'salso remove this because border is notbeing used in text field anymoreso let's get rid of this save itrestart our entire app Ctrl Jor command J no problem we come away andour entire apps design is now changedthis is how it looks in Cupertino designand I'm quite satisfied with how thebutton is looking over here so I'm notgoing to meddle with the size howeveryou can go ahead and change it also if Ipass 200 click on convert it's stillworking if I press 12 it's still workinggreatso this is how the app looks inCupertino design this is how the app isgoing to look like in material designyou can design for yourself which oneyou want I like this one better becauseit gave me more customizabilityand I just like the design and feel ofitI don't like how the text Fields look inCupertino design the main difference isthat material design follows a moreDynamic and Visually Rich approach ituses Shadows depth effects bold colorsand it often incorporates elements thatmimic Real World objects and materialsthat's why material designnow Cupertino design has a moreminimalistic and flat aesthetic andfocuses on Simplicity subtle gradientsandalthough I do like minimalistic designCupertino design is just not my tasteso from nowon I'm going to go ahead anddesign only material designedapplications if you want you got a tasteof how Cupertino Works basically anywidget you havejust put a Cupertino before it andyou'll get a widget similar to that andif you don't you always have Googlewhere you can ask your questionabout the equivalent oflet's say a particular widget inmaterial designin Cupertino design okayso we are done there's one last thingthat I want to mention and that thisgoes for both of theseclasses currency converter material pageand currency converter Cupertino pageand that's the use of text editingcontroller whenever youany form of controllers later on we'llsee that there are a bunch ofcontrollerslike there's animation controller orpage controller draw controller scrollcontroller stream controller which we'vealready seenall of those need to be canceled ordisposed ofso that they don't have any data leaksor memory leaks in your applicationso for that reasonthe state also gives us a nice propertyor a nice function which is the disposefunctionin dispose functionit is usually recommended to putsuper.dispose at the last and in itsstate you might remember that super.netstate should be the first thing andafter that you will have rest of theother things because then you want tocall the parent class and initializeeverything but in this pose you justremoving certain objects from yourwidget treeand this dispose is called whenever yourwidget is no longer existing maybe youmove from one page to another byreplacing the current page this is whenthe disposefunction will get called so in that caseyou don't want to instantly delete ordispose of whatever is present in thestate class first you want to dispose ofyour ownclassesyour own controllers and streams orFutures whatever you want to disposeand then you'll call Super dot disposeto dispose of everything that's presentin theState class all right so here what I'mgoing to do is pass in my text editingcontroller and call dispose method on itso this will dispose of the text editingcontroller it willbasically discard the entire textediting controller and say that hey thisobject is basically not existing anymoreand that avoids memory leaks all rightso you can consider dispose to bekind of like the exact opposite of NHstate in its state gets calledbefore the build function beforeanything builds and this pose getscalled right after the entire widgetis going to get discardedcool so let's get rid of this and now weare done with our entirecurrency converter app congratulationson building your first ever flutter appwhich is working quite wellto understand about widget life cycle wemust first know what widgets are andwhat a life cycle is everything influtter is a widget so before knowingabout lifecycle we must first know whatthe widgets are and if you are seeingthis video there's a great possibilitythat you have already created widgets inyour app to Define it in the least wordspossible widget can be considered asevery class you make and can call in thebuild function without any errors and ifyou don't know what build function is itis a function that is used to rendersomething on the screen every flutterapp is a combination of two type ofwidgets stateless widgets and statefulwidgets stateless widgets are those typeof widgets where the state once createdcannot be changed that is it can runonly once which is when the app isloaded this also means that this type ofwidget cannot be redone after any userinteractionsthis is an example of stateless widget astateful widgets on the other hand arewidgets where the state can be changedand we can make this build function overhere run multiple times with differentwidgets to render or different string ina text any value can be changed nowlet's understand the life cycle of thesewidgets so we are back to our statelesswidget and as you can see that the mystateless widget which is a class nameof a stateless widget has overridden thebuild function here which can writtenreturn only one widget at the end whichhere we are returning a scaffold sowhenever my stateless widget isinstantiated it will call the buildfunction and draw that one widget on thescreenso if we have to understand it in achart flowchart formatfirst we call the Constructorand then after which the build functionwill get executed pretty simple rightnow what about State full widgets wehave a Constructor hereafter which the build function will becalled right no you see in this codedemo my stateful widget is a statefulwidget and we have a build function herebut before that you can see create Stateover hereas the name suggests this creates thestate of our app it also returns aninstance of the associated statenow that we have access to the state inour app flutter provides us with somemethods to use as and when we want firstis in its state and this is how you cancreate in its state functionwhat is in its state right in its stateis the method which runs once after theConstructor of our app and created stateis calledsince it basically runs in the verybeginning of the app we can initializedata and properties with some value wecan also subscribe to streams and makeconnections with sockets let me show youa demo suppose I have a variable of datatype end and I'll call it ABC and I haveto instantiate it with a value I canjust do it like thisor I can justmark this as latego over here and put ABC equal to 10.now I'll go in the text and over hereI'm going to return abc.2 string sincetext accepts a string formatand I'm not going to return it as aconstant because the value can changenow if I go over here and let me returnmy state full widget over here you cansee that we are getting 10 as ouroutputted value and that is exactly whatwe wantednow I'll also take a moment to explainthe General Internal working of NH stateif we scroll up and we see that ourclass inherits from state which is anabstract classas you can see over here we also haveoverride over here which means we aretelling flutter that we are putting inits state over here and it isn't amistake we are deliberately trying toadd our own energy State function andnot use the image State function presentin the state abstract class super overhere creates a reference to the parentobject in state classand then calls the NH State functionthere as well now where should I placethe code I want to execute in the NHState function right over here on thetop or over or below it well flutterdocumentation says that the code shouldbe placed after calling super in itsstateexactly like I've done for the variableABCbut after further inspection in thestate class I'll go to the NF Statefunction in the state class over hereI found out that the initi statefunction basically does nothing thataffects our app so I don't think itmatterswherever we place the code this sameinternal working is followed in everyfunction that we're going to have a lookat uh in the following tutorial thesecond function that we have over hereis did change dependencies this methodis called immediately after energy Statemethod moreover this budget will becalled again after the piece of the datathe widget depends on is updated thisfunction is used very rarely as a buildmethod is called after this next we havea function called did update widget thisfunction runs whenever the widgetattached to the state is replaced byanother's widget here you can see thatwe are also getting our old widget whichis replaced and if you want to get thedata of the new widgetyou can just do print and use the widgetthat we always havethis function is used rarely as welllast method we have to discuss isdisposethis function is used to remove all theconnections our app has this is a veryimportant function most of the peopleforget to use and I admit even I haveforgotten many a times dispose is aplace where we can subscribe from allthe connections or listeners thus ithelps us in removing some things fromthe app's memory and prevents our appfrom memory leaks let me prove what I'msaying with the help of the code nowI'll write print everywhere in our appand all the functions that we haveI'll write here from init stateI'm just going to copy this printcommand and paste it in all ourfunctionsfrom dispersefrom did updatesorry from dead update widgetfromdid changedependenciesand even over here in the create stateI'm just going to replace this ArrowfunctionI'm just going to copy this I'm going toreturn this we have the my statefulwidget stateand over here I'm going to printfrom create stateover here as well I'm going to replaceI'm going to printand we are going to type fromConstructorrightnow we can just ignore the warnings thewarnings that we haveI'll refresh our appand let me just remove the int ABC partsfrom here as well and I'm going tointroduce a part of the code uh where wecan see something interesting happeningnot just a piece of text that's showingupI'm going to replace thiswith this cool now let me run my app andnow you can see that if we click overhere we get a model bottom sheet withwhich three uh with three optionsand if we go over here in our debugconsole let me justtake this up you can see that we firstgo to the uh we print from Constructorwhich is from your which proves that uhthe Constructor is uh run firstafter that create state is run as I saidbefore then the init State function isrunand then did change dependencies as rundid update widget and dispose do not runbecause we have not uh you know updatedany widget we have not replaced ourcurrent widget with any other widgetalso uh dispose is run after we need toclear off something suppose I have mysocket over hereand I have initialized it I haven't uhdownloaded any sockets package yet butI'm just showing it for the sake uh forshowing it that we can use dispose onsockets and if we call dispose over hereit will not give us any error at alland it will uh be a good thing for ourapps memory and we should alwaysunsubscribe from all the listeners thatwe have so that it doesn't keep on goingand cause harm in our applications rightnow if you prefer seeing this uhstateful widget in a flowchart formatlike we did for stateless widget hereyou have itso our state is first created then theiniti state function is run then ourbuild function is executedthen uh it checks if did update configor set state in our app is called yeahyou might be familiar with stat Statethat's why I have not included this inmy tutorial right nowso basically if you don't know what setstate is set State uh will help you torerun your build function againso you can rerun this whole entire uhfunction after calling such state so ifyou want to update any value and show ituh to the user on the screen you canjust use such State then uh if any ofthese is called then it will again goback and call our build function as wecan see in the flowchart over herethen we have our dispose function overhere and after that our app is clearedoff now the second app that we are goingto build is a weather app where thingsare going to get a little bit morecomplicated but not very complicated solet's dive into it and first of alllet's just see a demo of what we aregoing to build so this is the weatherapp we want to buildat first we have the app bar or theheader kind of thing then we have thetemperature showing up in Mumbai you caninsert any place you want in degreeFahrenheit it also tells you what typeof weather it is like if it's rainingsunny and it shows the appropriatesymbol for it then we get the weatherforecast since the time right now is 840 AM it shows me the weather forecastfrom 9 am to 9 PM with 3r interval thenwe have additional information abouthumidity when speed and pressure thegood thing about all of this isthis is not hard-coded like we did inthe currency converter app it is takingactual data from the web and displayingit over here so the actual weather inMumbai right now is 300.67 degreeFahrenheit also I have the refreshbutton here in case I want to reruneverything and you see as soon as Ipress refresh I get a loading indicatorand it pulls the actual data from theweb so for this purpose we are using anAPI here and we learn how to do this influtter so let's go ahead and create aweather app so the first step is goingto be to create a flutter project for itso go ahead create your own flutterproject I'll CD to desktop which meanschange the directory to desktop andafter that I'll run the flutter createcommand for weather app all rightafter that I can change the directory tothe weather app and as soon as I typeweather and press tab it will autocomplete it for meand we'll type weather app for meafter this I want to open it in vs codeI can either go ahead and open VisualStudio code like this and you knowclose the current folder I'm in and justdrag this app right over here or whatyou can do is type in code which willopen up vs code for you now if itdoesn't open up what you need to do ispress command shift p and vs codethen passcode like this and you'll see thiscommand shell command install codecommand and path once you click overhereyou'll be able to use code like this andopen Visual Studio code from theterminal itselfCode full stop basically means that openvs code for the current folder if wewere back in the desktop we would haveto do code dot slash weather app allright and it will open up my weather appin vs code gray now let's open it upbacklet's start running our app to see ifeverything is all right hereand then we'll also migrate to the libfolder in main.dot because I want tomake sure you understand the defaultcode for the counter app that's writtennow that you know the very basics offlutterso at the top we have the run app and wehave my app it also extends thestateless widget where we have materialapp title this title basically tells youthe thing that shows up here in Androiddevices for iOS it justtakes the thing that is mentioned ininfo dot P list now what is info.plistwell if you press command p and typeinfo dot P list you'll see iOS slashRunner all right this is present in theiOS folder where they have defined thename for our app which is the weatherappso it takes the name from here if youwant to change the name of the iOS youknow this name hereyou'll have to change it in iOS slashRunner slash info dot P listand for Android you can change it fromhere awesome so our app is also runningnow we have our theme here and it takesa theme data then passes in a colorscreen and passes in a seed color basedon which we have our entire design readythen it also has use material 3 set totrue now there'smaterial 2 and material 3 which arebasically versions of material designmaterial 3 came out recently and flutterhas the option to use material 3 designso this is how the app looks in material3 design and if I just remove it save itthis is how it looks in material too sothat is the difference between material3 and material 2. definitely I likematerial 3 better but you can look foryourselfand this is what team does when youdefine a theme over here it sets up theoverall coloring scheme and let's saytypography all of that stuff for theentire app if you want to go ahead andchange a one particular screen you cando that but what theme does is set setup for the entire app because that'swhat material app is rightthen we have home where we pass in myhome page and in my home page we extenda stateful widget we have a titlewhich we are taking from The Constructorwhich is flutter demo home page and it'sshowing up in app bar so if we scrolldown we have Abbawhere we have title text widget.titlebut an interesting thing over here isbackground colorwhat it does is theme dot off context togo to the theme then use the colorscheme dot inverse primary so it'sbasically going to this theme widgetright over herethen it's saying give me color schemesinverseprimary property which is defined in thecolor scheme if you scroll down you'llsee inverse primary now if you setinverse primary color over here let's goahead and try it inverse primary colorsdot blue save it come over here you seethe I bar is now blue in color becausewe are accessing color scheme dotinverse primary when we don't specifyanything and just specify the seed colorit takes a light purple kind of shadebut when we specify the inverse primarycolor it takes a different colorand this is what theme is all about youset it somewhere like let's say you setthe theme over here and then TheDescendant widgets can use it or thechild widgets can use itthen we have Body Center column and Mainaccess alignment Dot Center because ofwhich these two things are showing up inthe center you can see a constant textand a counter textand that is why we have a statefulwidget herealso we have something known as afloating action button which shows thebutton over herenow if you wanted a normal button overhere you could use elevated or flatbutton or text buttonbut since you want to use a button overhere it's better to use Floating Actionbutton which is provided as a propertyon scaffoldand then you can Define The FloatingAction buttonwidget and then obviously just go aheadand look out for yourself like whatevernamed properties are there everything iswritten pure English for you tounderstandwe also have the tooltip property whichis basically like if you long pressyou'll see this thing right hereincrement text that is wall tool tip isthen you have the icon as the childbecause of which we have this plusbuttonand then we have on pressed incrementcount and increment counter we are justdoing such stateand in there we are changing the valueof underscore counterso that's our counter app now we're justgoing to go ahead and remove everythingbecause we want to build our own weatherappand now let's start from scratch I hopeyou understood everything in the counterapp because you've learned so much aboutstateless stateful set State everythingnow let's go ahead and create a classI'm not deleting the main functionwe'll have a class called my appor you can call it weather app whateveryou want to call it this this todayshould extend stateless widgetand instead of doing all of this we canjust do stateless widget like thisand call Maya cool now you're having aplaceholder here because of which wehave this lines over here placeholder isbasically telling that hey you wantsomething to be put up over here so I'lljust put it up for youlike this so it indicates that you wantto put some kind of widget hereand this should take this much spacethis much height you see we havefallback width and fallback heightstroke width and all of that stuff butinstead of returning a placeholder wewant to return a material appand in material app we first want to setthe home which islet's say constant where the screen andthat's something I want to createso let's minimize the iOS folder go tothe left folder create one more file andlet's call this weather underscorescreen dot Rod remember the name inconvention herethen we are going to import material dotso let's go ahead and import materialdot dotthen we will go into createa state less widget let's say because Idon't know if I need to put a state ornot so for now let's put a statelesswidget here then we'll save it I'll takethis weather screen put it herethen press command full stop so that Iget a list of quick fixes where I canimport my weather screen package allrightthen another thing that I want to do isafter I save it you see this debugBanner is showing this tells that ourapp is in debug board but for now I justwant to remove it completely so what Ican do is debug show check mode mannerset it to false with this property setto falsethe debugBanner over here is removedand the last thing that I want to setover here is the theme so right now mytheme is going to be light modeso if I just return let's say a scaffoldhere you'll understand what I'm talkingaboutit's light mode right I want to changeit to dark mode so I can just do it intheme otherwise I'll have to do it inthe background color yeah so we havecolors.black but what if my weatherscreen or my weather app has more thanjust one page do I have to go about andchange the background color everywhereremember our diagramthe theme over here is going to set itfor the entire app it's going to be theglobal thing but for weather screen inthe scaffold it's just going to be therefor one particular pageand now you might be able to see theresults butit doesn't set it for the entire appit's just for one screen so what I wantto do is go to the main dot dot set thetheming up so I'm going to have themedataand then you can pass in theme data butwhat I want to do is use the presetthemes given which is theme data dot docor light modeyou can use either of themor you can just Define your custom themedataall of these work all right with customtheme data you can go and set yourbackground color you can set much morestuff but that's not what I'm going todo I'm not going to start writing fromscratch I'm just going to use theme datadot dotwith Doc I have access to the darkbackground you see but still this istheme data.doc and this is fine but Iwant to use material 3 because I likethat very much so you see it has a namedproperty of use material 3.I can pass and use material 3 and itrequires a Boolean value so I can set itto trueand it will start using material 3 andyou see the background color over herechanges now at if at all you want tochange the background color what you cando is dot copy with and set your owncustom stuff over here so it will havethe dark color properties andif you want to change anything at allyou can change it with copy widthso let's say the Abba color over here isblue it's not actually blue but let'ssay in theme data.doc the app bar coloris blue you want it to set it to Whiteyou can just go ahead and set the Abbatheme over hereso what it will do is copy everythingfrom theme data.doc including app barthen it will see this copy with functionand it will override the existing appbar theme with the app bar theme Iprovide over hereall rightso it just takes this and copieswhatever is present inside of it withthe existing theme data so I hope thatmakes sense it's quite intuitive but Idon't want anything like that I justwant this simple line to be present allright now let's go to the weather screenand designer app now what do I want thefirst thing that I require is an app barso with me I have the iOS screenshothere now what I'm going to do is go overit step by step and we'll see how tomake this kind of UI if you want to tryit on your own go ahead try it it willbe a good learning but if you can'tlet's design it on our own we'll getsome practice and maybe after that youcan start designing your own stuffbecause this is going to have manyimportant widgets discoveredso the first thing that I require is anapp bar with a title weather app so weare going to go ahead and have an appbar pass in app bar maybe already seenand you see as soon as I collab I haveto remove constant from here becauseAbba isn't a constant you can see itinside of here in the Constructor noconsnow we want the title which will be aconstant text and we're going to callthis let's say weather app let's goahead and type itsave it and we see whether operatingover here perfectnow still the textile doesn't look verygood because this is bolded so let's goahead and set the textile Vilas Styletextilefont weight to be font weight dot boldwe've seen exactly this and this is nicethe next thing I want is a refreshbutton over here also I want to makesure that my title is always centeredirrespective of whether it is on Androidor iOS so I'm going to set Center titleto truegreat no visible changes but on Androidyou'll see the changenow the next thing I want is a refreshicon over herehow to add that now I told you in thefirst app that whenever you want to addany icons over here or any sort ofwidget we have to use the actionsproperty present inside of the app barso we are going to use exactly that weare going to have actions and here weare going to mention our icon which isgoing to be icons dot refreshAlso let's put a constable here save itand we have our icon showing upbut the problem with it is this icon isnot clickableyou know if I click on it it doesabsolutely nothingI want to make sure that it still doessomething whenever I click on itso for that we'll need an on tapproperty and like some sort of detectorthat hey this has been clicked so forthis we need to use a button rightnot always you can use a button overhere but sometimes you just don't wantto use a button what you want to useinstead is an icon wrapped witha widget known as gesture detector soyou can press Ctrl shift r on Mac andthen you'll get these refactoringoptions and you can wrap with somethingknown as a gesture detectorand gesture detector isn't a constant solet's remove it let's put const for ouriconnow we'll put a comma so that theformatting takes place and we get in aformat like thisnow what I want to do is use some of theproperty given by gesture detector whichis on tapwith ontap we have access to the clickproperty so whenever we click on thiswe can run a particular function justlike we do in a button so we can havethe ontar property defined here andlet's say print refreshlet's save it press Ctrl command Jrestart an entire app let's click overhere and it says refreshagain if we click it says refresh sothis is being clicked on but one problemI have is there is no splash effectlike when I click on it there should besome kind of radial Splash shown so forthat kind of detection what I want to dois wrap it with inquel Widget Inkwellalso hassimilar set of properties it doesn'thave as advanced properties as a gesturedetector it has lesser properties thangesture detector but what Inkwell doesis give you a splash effect so when youclick on this you get this nice Splasheffectso you can use either of themin this scenario and it will work fineI'm going to go ahead with gesturedetector and be done butthere's another thing you can do insteadof using gesture detector and icon wehave something known as an icon buttonsoit is an icon and a button so it allowsyou to pass the on press property and anicon so in our icon we are going to haveicon icons dot refreshand then you have the on press propertyso you can do the same task in multipleways and you can have the same UIit depends on you what you want to dobut with icon button basically you havethe nice cool Splash effect which is nota not a square it is a circle plus youget the nice padding overallin gesture detector and I can you wouldhave to set your own padding property sothat it didn't get stuck in the righthand corner with icon button it providesyou withthe padding by itself cool now we aredone with the Abba now let's get to thebody and make some stuff so the firstthing I want to make is this big bulkright here we're not going to actuallyget some data as of right now we'regoing to put in some false data hereand when we connect to an API which isafter creating our UIwe'll replace all the values but as ofright nowwe are going to put in random values solet's go ahead in our scaffoldwe are in a scaffold let's make sureand then here we are going to pass abody property and in a body what do werequire wellfirst thing to analyze is the properlayout what is the layout of this appwell everything is below one another ina vertical manner so obviously we needto use columns so that we have access tochildren and because of that we can puteverything inside of oneparticular widgetand it should be vertically below eachotherso let's go ahead and pass a column overhere column will have childrenand the first child is going to be thismain cardso let's put a comment here saying maincard so that we know what we need towork onthen if you want you can put in aplaceholder here saying that heythis much space is going to be given toourmain cardnow to change the height you know it'staking a lot of height maybe you can goahead and change the properties here andthe property I want to change isfallback height so let's change it tolet's say250 and maybe it takes this much spacewhich is fineand in the child we are going to pass ina constant text sayingmain card save it come over here you seemain card but now the fallback heightand fallback width will disappear whybecause you've said the child as a textnow this parent will take only as muchheight and width as this text requiresas much as a child requires this is notheight but fallback height fallbackheight is basically like hey you haven'tmentioned any child if you haven'tmentioned any child this is the heightwe are going to go to but if you havementioned a child we are going to takeas much speed as the child requires soif we remove the child and come overhere this looks great all rightnow after that the second thing werequire is where the forecast cardswe need these cards over here rightso where the forecast cards again youcan place a placeholder hereand let's say the fallback height is 150looks good enough maybe we need a sizingwire so we'll have constant size boxheight 10 which will help us to leavespacing we've already seen this beforebut this is two lesser space so let's goahead and add 20 let's say this looksgood and after that we'll haveadditional information so again we'llleave some heightand then we'll have a placeholder againlet's say 150 againso this is the overall layout of our appvery simply laid out first we are goingto have our main card then we are goingto have our weather forecast cards andafter thatwe are going to have our additionalinformationso let's get started by designingeverythingthe first thing we need to design is themain card so how is our main card goingto look like well let's analyze itit does have a color of its ownit does have a 3d effectit has its nice own curvesbecause if we just use a container whichwould be the first thing that goes inour mind that hey this is a very bigthing and it has these curvesit has a colorit requires a children over here like wewant to display a text we want todisplay an icon we want to display againa textso the first thing that might come inour mind is a containerbut it has an elevation and containerdoesn't have an elevation property sodefinitely we cannot use a containerhowever what we can use is somethingknown as a card widget so if we just usea card widget we'll be able to use itnow as soon as you have a card you knowone placeholder goes away but now let'sstart designing a carin a cardwe require these three childrenso we need degree Fahrenheit text weneed this thing right here and we needdrainso in a card we are going to have achild propertywe are going to we are going to have acolumn and here we are going to mentionchildren obviously because everything inis in a vertical formatso you want a column over here withoutcolumn you won't get access to Childrenyou can use row which will also give youaccess to children but it will be in ahorizontal manner we don't want thatso we'll use column awarenow we need text so we are going to passin a text and the text is going to belet's say300 Fahrenheit now I also want access todegreebut there's no degree sign on mykeyboard at least what I can see so whatI'm going to do is go to Google searchfor degree symbol and just copy thedegree from hereclose my Safari tabhave 300 degree Fahrenheit like this andwe see 300 degree Fahrenheit coollet's put a comma so that we have aformatting in placeperfectnow I want to design this further nowfirst of all let's go ahead and increasethe font size and the font weight of ourtemperature so we're going to have styletextile and the textile is going to befont size 32 font weight font weight dotbull I want it bolded and this font sizeis a tried and tested value I've builtthis app before so I know I want thefont size of 32 but when I was buildingthis app I constantly tried and see sawwhat font size I preferred and this isthe font size I prefer now if you lookclosely at it you'll see there's somesort of background on it that is quiteevident and that is our card widget cardgives us access to an elevation stuffwhichyou can see over hereand you can toggle it on or off like ifyou want elevation to be zero it will becompletely gone but if you remove thisit has some sort of elevation of its ownnow we have a card but the problem rightnow is the card is not taking themaximum width it is only taking as muchof it as this text requires so what Ican do is wrap my card with a containerwhich will tell it to take the maximumwidthso for this I'll press Ctrl shift R getthe refactoring options and wrap it withcontainer and here I'm going to mentionthe width which is going to be doubledot Infinity saying that hey takemaximum amount of width and you see ittakes the maximum amount of widthhowever we have a warning here I meanthe entire app isn't warning but evenhere we have a warning saying use a sizebox to add white space to a layout sowhenever you want to set up width asI've already told you before you alwaysneed to use size boxwhen you have to use something more thanjust a width or a height let's say colorborder radius all of those stuff youhave to use container then but thenbut if it's only with then go ahead withsize boxand we see the same thingnow the width is stretched it takes themaximum amount of width possible so Ihope you are understanding how flutterlayouts workearlier we had not set any widthconstraints on this cardit was free to use whatever space itrequiredand therefore it depended on its childand its child was column columns widthdepends on its children and its childrequired only this much space but thenwe addeda constraint on our card saying that heytake the maximum amount of widthpossible so it went ahead and tookdouble dot Infinity which has themaximum amount of space it can takerightso keep this layout thing in mindbecause it's the most important aspectof flutter you need to understand howlayout and UI work now the problem isit's taking the maximum amount of spaceI do want it to leave spacing from hereand if you see in a layout everything inour column takes this amount of space soI think on the column property they haveset the padding property padding is notspecific to One widget that hey onlythis much only this widget requiresspacing from here not these widgets wellall of the widgets required the spacingfrom here so we can safely assume thatwe can set the padding property on thiscolumnnot on One widget of course you can goahead and set padding property on everywidget in our chat in our column but itwould make much more sense to do it forthe entire column so we can have Ctrlshift R then we are going to wrap itwith padding and we are going to set itto let's say 16.because it's much more than just eightit would be somewhere over here and 16is over here which looks goodgreat now you see there is spacing overhere here everywhere that's goodnow let's put more children to ourcolumn we are going to have our icon nowso we are going to have icon icons DotCloud as of now it's going to be astatic value so let's put a cloud andthe size is quite small so let'sincrease its size so we're going to havea size of 32it's still small nothing big so let's goahead with 48still quite small and let's go aheadwith 64.now it looks big enoughso we can go ahead with thisalso if you want to increase the heightof your emulator you can do it bystretching it then after this icon whatwe require is this subtext so let's putthat you're going to have textdrainstyle is going to be let's say textilefont size16 let's go ahead with thatit's quite small what my thought processis is like hey this is almost 32 thenthis is 64 and this is very smallcompared to both of these things so wecan go ahead and let's say set the fontsize to 20 so it will look decent enoughin front of themand I think that looks good so we havethe content inside of the card setupbut if you see there's much more spacingover herebetween these things so we can set thatup as well we are going to have aconstant sized box of height 16 anddon't worry about the errors if you areconcerned about them because theseerrors will go away as soon as you put aconst for example if I just put aconstable here most of the errors justgo away rightI am not putting them becauseI know that later on I want to set aborder radius property and Border radiusas you know border radius dot circularis not a constant if it's not a constantI cannot set itto a constant right so instead of doingand wasting time setting up cons whatI'm going to do is let the warnings bethereand wait for the Border radius propertyto be set up so that we can put a nicecurve over hereso we've put a size box over here thisleaves a good spacing we're going to dothat again after the cloud icon that'snicenow if you compare it to thisin layout terms it looks quite similarexceptif you see over here there's pacing ifyou see over here there's spacing buthere there is no spacing added over hereso there are two options we can take inthe column we can set the size box overhereas the first child in a column and atthe end againor you can just wrap this columnproperty withpadding againand this padding is limited only to ourcolumn so I'm going to go ahead with thecolumn property because I don't likeputting size boxes where it's notactually necessary so I'm going to goahead and press Ctrl shift rape it with padding and it's going to beEdge and such dot all16 save it come over here and this looksbetter definitelythe next thing I require is theelevation to be bigger as you can seethe Shadows are bigger so let's go aheadand set our custom elevation propertyfor our card which is going to beelevation let's say 10. when we do thatthis is much stronger and appears more3D it gives a better visual effectthe next thing we want to do isset a nice border radius it should bemore curved than what we have right nowso in our card we can go ahead and setthe shape property where it requires aborder and here we can pass in a roundedrectangular border what we've alreadyseen before right most of the widgetsare repeating we did learn a new thingabout a cardbut rest of the things are quite similaryou just need to understand what youneed to do and start doing it foryourself and you see as soon as I puttrack rounded rectangular border andsave it I geta pointy border because I need to customset my border radius over here so I'llgo ahead and set my border radius toborder radiusdot circular and as soon as I do borderradius dot circular the warnings shouldgo away and here my border radius isgoing to be 16 and as soon as I do thatlook there's more curve attached overhere that looks perfectthe warnings go away from herehowever there are warnings over here solet's go ahead and put Constable let'sremove unnecessary consbecause their parent is a constant coolso we have this thing over here itdoesn't look very same to thisbut it does have the proper layout thething that we are missing is the nicemerging filter between them right nowit's clearly visible that hey there's anelevation property and doesn't mergewith the backgroundto make it merge with the backgroundlike this we need to have access to Onewidgetwhich isa backdrop filter what backdrop filterwill do is basicallyblur the background in the X and Ydirections so X will be the horizontalDirection y will be the verticalDirection think of it in graph and blurthe backgroundand once it blurs the background you'llhave a nice effectlet's see what I'm talking about if Ijust wrap mypadding Widget the column is wrapped bypadding and if we wrap the paddingwidget withbackdrop filter we get access to thenamed parameter of filterand here we need to pass an image filterso we need to pass an image filter andif we do this much it's not allowedbecause image filter is not an abstractclass but it doesn't have a Constructorof its own or actuallyit is an abstract class and it doesn'thave a Constructor of its own meaningthis abstract classcannot be extended you seeso having something like this imagefilter dot underscore and thenparenthesis basically means that thisCon theConstructor of this abstract classcannot be called any timethat's why I said this is not anabstract class it's it just has itsConstructor privatizedbut in reality this is an abstract classwhose Constructor is also privatized youknow privatized as always by underscoreso they've put an underscore over thereokayso let's come back over here and useimage filter dot because we know imagefilter is not extended if it's notextended there can be no class we canput here except image filter itselfthat's why I call Image filter Dotnow if you didn't understand what I wastalking about what I was saying is imagefilter is basically a privatizedConstructor so that means image filtercannot be a parent class of any otherclass because extended is not allowedso definitely I cannot put anything elseover here I need to put image filteronlyso I called image filter Dot and thatgives us access to multiple methods wecan useyou can use blur compose dilate erodeI'm going to go ahead with blur thatwill blur my backgroundand here I can pass in Sigma X whichwill be let's say 10and if you hover over this you seecreates an image filter that applies agaussian blur and then we have Sigma Ywhich is again going to be 10. so fromthe X and Y direction we want 10 and youseeit basically merges with the backgroundbut then its elevation kind of goes awayto prevent that we can adda border radius property to thisbackdrop filter itselfso you can press Ctrl shift R then wrapit with a clip or rect widget whichallows you to put a border radiusproperty if you wrap it again with acard so that you can set up order radiusproperty it wouldn't make sense what youneed to do is put clip rack what clip RXwill do is clip it clip it according tothe properties you mentioned and itallows you to put border radiusand it also has a custom Clipper you canpass in but right now we just want toput a border radius for that clip ourwrecked is enough so you can put borderradiusand Border radius is going to be thesame thing as this one if it isdifferent values it will look a bitweird and you see as soon as we addborder radius the elevation propertiesthere and we get a nice cool effectlooking like this cardso I hope you understand what I did overhere I applied a backdrop filter becauseof which everything was leveled into oneplace and there was blur over here thenI wrapped it with a clip rack widgetbecause of which it applied its ownborder radius it separated the blurfrom the background and gave it a nicelookso we have a nice littlebackdrop filter as well as the Borderradius which looks exactly like thiswidget now I know this is an importantor a difficult concept to grasp but youcan play around with yourself you knowyou can just remove this widget againand see how it looks after adding lip RXwidget you'll again see how it looksgreat so we have our main card designangle and in my opinion it looks justperfectnow let's go ahead and design theweather forecast and additionalinformation tabsso for weather forecast we have to leavesome spacing which we've already done Iassume here we have itsize box height 20after that I need a text saying weatherforecastso I'm going to have a constant textsaying whether for castsave it and when you have an error andyou save itit doesn't hot reload but when you saveit after no errors you see where theforecast over herenow let's put style over here we aregoing to have style as textile then weare going to have font size as 24 whichis a big value then font weight which isgoing to be font weight dot boldand we have our weather forecast showingup over here which looks goodnow what I want to do is it is mentionedin the center I want to take it to theleft hand side so for that I can wrap mytext widgetin a widget known as alignwhat align does is basically certainalignment of where you want it to be inthe column do you want it in the leftview do you want it in the center youwant it in the right top right whateverand align has alignment property nowinstead of using a line you can go aheadand use container which also has analignment property but at the end of theday container inside uses alignmentor align widget which is the same thingso let's go ahead and pass alignmentnow alignment requires alignmentgeometry but its default value isalignment Dot Center we can set it to adifferent value by using alignment Dotand you see we have a bunch of optionsbottom center bottom left bottom rightcenter Center left center right topCenter top left top right what I want todo isCenter in the left hand sideso I'm going to use Center left save itand we have it displayed over herenow instead of doing this alignment DotCenter left what you could do isremove the Align widget go to yourcolumnthis column not this column that we haveover here this column is related tothese things over here we want to go tothe column that controls all of thesethingsand here set the cross access alignmentto cross access alignment dot start assoon as you do that everything startsfrom the left hand sidefrom hereso as I've already mentioned before andI'll do it again if you've forgottenmain axis is this thing right over hereand cross axis is everything from yearto yearso when we set cross access alignmentdot start everything starts from here ifI set it to cross access alignment dotend everything from will start from hereokaythe difference between using a linewidget over here and using cross accessalignment is this cross access alignmentwill set it for all the descendingwidgets for these cards that we'lldisplay for additional information forthese things over here butalign only sets it for one particularwidget in our case that was the weatherforecast widgetcoolso let's go down we have our weatherforecast looks goodnow we are going to have our size boxagain so we are going to set a size boxof height 20 againsave itthen what we want is a list of widgetsshowing up over here and how this worksissomething like this this is scroll levelokay because there are more thanthree things that we want to display onthe screen together and we still want todisplay more stuffso it is scrollable over here so I wantthat scrollable thing to be present howcan I do that well I can put a row thatwould be goodand inside of the row I can displaythese cards that sounds good so let's goahead and create a rowin our row we are going to have childrenand my first child is going to be wellthis thing over hereso I have to design this component on myownso let's go ahead and Design This so weare going to have well again a cardbecause it has an elevation and thissort of looks like a card only just likewe had before right it has elevation ofits own so it gives like a3D visual it's coming on the top of yourscreen and that is what a card is so wecan use a card againthen we can use a childand the child is going to havewell a column directly which shows aTime the cloud icon again and thetemperatureso we're going to have our childcolumnthen children and the first child is thetime so my time is let's say zero threezero zerolet's save it come over here and we seethis perfectbut the problem right nowis my card only taking as much width asmy text require and definitely my textis not going to require this much spaceso what I can do is set a custom heightor width again so I'm going to wrap mycard widget witha size box again where I'll set a customwidth to let's say 100 save it come overhere and this looks bigger nicenow after this text we are going to havea sized boxbut even before that let's go ahead andset the properties of this text thistext is bigger in size than this thingright here and it's also bolded so weneed to set two properties inside of thestyle and we've done this so many timesI hope you can do this on your own inthe textile we are going to have fontsizeand the font size is 16. font weight andthe font weight is fontway dot bull saveit come away and this looks goodnow after this we leave our space againso we have constantsizeboxand then we have our height set to 8 weleave 8 spacingand after that we need a cloud iconagain so we have icon icons dot cloudand the size is let's say 32.save it and we'll have a cloud icon ifwe remove the size icon and just displayit it's quite small and since I knowit's small I set it to 32 but it reallyall depends on how you want it to lookit can look a different and you'll befine with it but I like this look betterI'm trying to replicate what I justcreated over herein our third app we're going to design adribble UIso you'll understand how to create onespecific UI but this weather page isyour own creativity so you can just dowhatever you want I'm going to followthis kind of designagain we use a spacing and to beconsistent with what we used above I'mjust going to copy paste my size boxand then we are going to use thetemperature so I'm going to copy thistext now paste it over here and let'ssay my temperature is320save itand this is bolded I don't want itbolderedAlso let's put decimal aware 320.12let's remove bold save itand it's quite big if you can see overhere closely look at it this text isbigger than this textwhy it's not because it's bolded it'sbecause its font size is bigger so weneed to reduce its font size let's tryto remove this textiles totallyand then we are able to match it thislooks better in my opinionall right so I'm going to use thisnow after thisumI do want padding to be present justlike we had in this card it's a totalreplica if you want to call that solet's go ahead and wrap our column witha padding property so we are going tohaveour column wrapped withpadding and padding is going to haveEdge in search dot all it save it andyou'd see it right over here looks goodand this looks just like how this looksalso the elevation is kind of small Ijust realized so let'sincrease the elevation as well to sixthen it looks much better and muchsimilar to what we have alreadyand one last thing that is there is theBorder radius this border radius is morecurved and this is slightly less curvedso we want to set a border radius onthis cardso we can either wrap the padding widgetwith a clip or Rec widget again so thatwe have the nice padding or we can justremove this padding and wrap it withcontainer then you pass a border radiusproperty to it now container doesn'thave a border radius property mentionedover here you can check for yourselfbut what it does have is decoration andwhat it requires is box decorationit requires just a decoration but if youtry to create just a decoration that'snot allowed because it's an abstractclass what you can use instead is boxdecoration and we've seen this classbefore where inCupertino design when we were trying todesign something we had to pass indecorationremember the text field that we addCupertino text field that had adecoration or a style property thatrequired box decoration and we passed inbox decoration that's exactly what weneed to pass in over here and then wecan pass in the Border radius which hasabout radius dot circularto let's say 12 or 10 or 16 whatever youwanttry test it on your own just see whatyou like and use it don't blindly followwhat I'm followingbecause you're building an app foryourself you want it to look how youthink it should look so this looks morecurved now and that's goodhowever this card doesn't look as goodas this one whybecause if you'll seethis text has more paddingand you can increase the padding overhere let's go ahead and set it to let'ssay 18. save it and you have morepadding but it still doesn't feel asgood the reason for that is quite simplewe have set a restriction over here thatyour width should be 100 no matter whatthe width should be 100 for the card nowif I remove thisand you know let's set it back to 12againwe have a card looking like this and itdoesn't look very goodthat's why we had set the size box to acard in the first placebut even with thatwe are just saying that hey the cardshould have a width of 100 that's notwhat we wantbecause then we are limiting the heightof the card what I want to do is set thecontent inside of it to have a width of100 so what I'm going to do is wrap thiscolumn with a width and since we alreadyhave a container we don't have to wrapit with the size box we can just mentionthe width property over here and set it200.and once we do that you see this cardlooks much better than we what we hadbeforeother problem that I have right now isthere's too much spacing over here thatthis card feels disconnected fromweather forecast it doesn't feel thatthis is a better forecast it just feelslike this is a thing of its own so let'sreduce the size box height over herelet's set it to 16.and then it looks much better otherwiseit just feels disconnected from wherethe forecast textsimple now what we want to do is takethis card and paste it five times rightso we can have one two three four fivesave itand we have the cards showing up nicelybut the problem isthey are exceeding the limit of thescreen obviouslywhy wouldn't they exceed the limit ofthe screen we only have space for 4.5or 3.5 cards plus we have a paddingproperty over here which restricts iteven more right we haveover here in the top of the columnpaddingagencies.all 16. so we are leaving apadding of 16 from here because of whichour cards can only come till here sothat's why we had this now how can Imake thesecards not these cards this entire rowscroll level so for that we have awidget we can just press Ctrl shift Rthen we'll have rapid widget and we havea widget known as single child scrollViewwhen we use this widget whatever childwe have inside of this is scrollable andwhen we save ityou see it's not really scrollable evenafter hot restarting and that's becauseit has a direction of its own it isscrollable only in the verticalDirection but not in the horizontalDirection so we can change its scrollDirection over here so we have scrollDirection access dot horizontal and oncewe do that the error goes away and thisthing right here is scrollableso with single child scroll view you'rebasically telling that hey whateverwidget you have and it exceeds a certainwidthor a certain size you can wrap it withsingle child scroll View and it willmake the entire screen scrollableand that's quite convenientand this is single child scroll viewbecause it only has one child and itsone child is a rownow if you want multiplechild scroll view you can look formulti-child scroll view but there'snothing like it because most of thetimes you'll only need a single childscroll view because then you can pass ina child and then your row column widgetswhatever you wantokayso let's go down and we have our stuffover here but you'll see we have toscroll much below just to see one cardwidget and since we are used reusing thesame card everywhereit causes a problem for uswhat problem let's say I want to changethe size of this icon I change I want tochange it to let's say 40. I want tomake it look biggernow what happens iswhen I change it over here I only changeit for one card I have to change it forall the other cardsso I'll have to go ahead copy this for Tpaste it over here overhere overhere and there's a possibility I missout on somethingalso since you have warnings I want tomake sure that everything is constantover here so the warnings go away so Ihave to manually do it for every singlecardnow that's not suitable is itso what I can do is extract this widgetout of here also press command Z to setit back to the original height becausethis size 32 is perfect for meso coming back to what I was talkingwhat I can do is extract this cardwidget into a separate class of its ownthat way I can just returnOne widget and I have a single source ofcontrol if I want to change how a cloudlooks I can change it in one particularwidget itself I don't have to go aheadand change it every single place justlike we did in Border remember when wehad our currency converter material pageand we had a border for our text fieldwe made a variable that made surethat you can have it over herenow what I'm going to do is instead ofcreating a variable I'm going to createa particular widget of its own so that Ican store itso what I'm going to do is take thiscardcontrol Xthen go outside of this class and createa stateless widgetlet's go outside of this class notinside of this class here we are goingto create stateless widgetand then we are going to call thiswidgetearlyforecastitem all right this is what I'm going tocall it why because it shows me theforecast for every r as simplenowI can copy this card I think I alreadycopied it but let's just do it againlet's return a card from here then put aconstant Also let's remove theunnecessary constant from size boxbecause their parent is a constantitselfnow we can take this early forecast iteminstead of returning a card I'm going toreturn Ali forecast iteminstead of returning a card again I'mgoing to return an Ali forecast itemlet's copy thisagain instead of returning a card Aliforecast item instead of returning acardhourly forecast itemso we have our four hourly forecastitems we are missing one let's putanother one so we have five cardsperfectso we have our layout done for this aswell then next thing is the last sectionthe additional information section sosimilarly we are going to remove thisplaceholder now no need for that wealready have that the last thing is thisadditional information we're going toleave a size box of height 20Also let's put a cons for the entiresingle child scroll Viewno errors now you see perfect then weneed a text again which has the sameheight as the weather forecast so I'mgoing to copy paste itand call this additionalinformationsave it come back over here and there wehave it now I challenge you to make thison your own we have sufficient knowledgeof what we need to do do you have to usea card do you have to use something elseyou have your own knowledge for this sogo ahead and try it out on your own andlet me know in the comment section ifyou were able to do itnow your code doesn't have to match mineif it looks similar then it's all goodif it doesn'tthen maybe you can copy my code howeverit's always good that you try it on yourownso let's go ahead and create first ofall a rowand even before that let's put a heightover hereconstant size box height 16 and afterthat I'm going to have a row where weare going to have children and the firstchild is going to beour first additional information itemwhich is this thing right here sosince they are vertically laid out I amjust going to put in a column so we havea columnin our column we have children in ourchildren we have an icon at firstand the icon is icons Dotand this is kind of likea drop iconso let's search for something icons dotwater water is kind of like a wave solet's put dropthere's nothing like Drop maybe waterdrop and we have water drop exactly likethis thing okay coolso we have our icon over here and whatI'm going to do is make sure my icon isas big as this icon there's consistencyin our UI which is good so we are goingto have a size of 32 which increases itsheightthen we are going to leave some spacingagain constant size box height eightagain consistency even here we had aspacing of eight same thing we are doingthen we have our text which says what'sthelabel for this so like what is the thingwe are showing we're showing humidityso let's have thatsave itlooks good enoughif we just scroll this back to thenormalthing yeah I think they're pretty muchthe same after this we can again leave aheightand then we needthe value like what's the value of thishumidity let's go ahead with 91producttextthen we need a style and this isdefinitely bigger so we just want toleave textilefont size 16 save it 91.but this is not bolded so let's go aheadand bold it now you understand what I'mdoing it's the same thing we are doingrepeatedly because these are a very fewwidgets that continuously keep repeatingrow column icon texticon button gesture detector Inkwellcontainer size box you know same thingskeep repeating for 90 of the uis thingslike backdrop filter come once in awhileso you don't have to worry aboutthose kind of widgets okay so we havehumidity over here and again the samelogicif I want to change the design ofthis thing I'll have tochange it three different times if Ipaste it like this you know since I wantthree columns over here I'll have tokeep pasting it again and againso instead what I can do is put it in awidget of its ownand I can do it right over here but theproblem I'm facing right now is I canstack everything up in one single filebut does that make sense if I puteverything in one file not reallyso I'm going to put everything indifferent files all right so I'm goingto go to the left folder I have whetherforecast item dot dot importflutter material dot over here then I'mgoing to paste itAli forecast item not weather forecastso let me rename thistoearly forecast item good naming is amust when it comes to programming justlike variablesthen we can press command full stop ittells us to import Ali forecast itemlet's do that save it then we can copythiscolumn make sure you copy this entirecolumnand we can create a widget of its ownnow there's a trick you can do insteadof creating it on yourself you can pressCtrl shift rthen you say extract widget give thewidget its name the name of this widgetis going to be additionalinfo itemnot N4 info item and you see it createsa widget by itselfit also automatically puts additionalinfo item over here let's put a constlet's remove size box from heresave it and we'll take this in aseparate file of its own again so wehave additionalinfoitem dot dot we can import flutternot physics dot dot material dot dot nowyou might say hey this is quiteredundant and why do you have tocontinuously keep doing it well that'sbecause when more Engineers are workingsegregation of files and having oneparticular component in one file willmake much more sense than havingeverything stuck together in one filewhat would happen if I just stuckeverything in just main.dot file itwasn't a good thingso I'm sticking everything in oneparticle offile of its ownnow let's import this thing right hereby pressing command full stop againand let's put additional info item threetimescool now the problem here is everythingis stuck together so do I have to add apadding widget not exactly becausepadding widget willnot make sure that they are spaced outevenly if you see aware everything isspaced out evenlywhat can I do such that just pasteevenly so for that row gives us aproperty in its mean access alignmentwhich we then discuss remember we addmain access alignment Dot and we add abunch of options over here Center wasbasically centering everything end wasbasically taking everything to the endstart wasputting everything to the start butthere were three options that we didn'ttalk about space around space betweenspace evenly because those required youto have multiple components and in ourappin our first app we didn't have thosecomponentsand when we did have those componentslike text text field and button I forgotto mention it so here I'm mentioning itand this same thing is even there forour column all rightwe'll take a look after we take a lookat this main access alignment propertiesso first option we have is space aroundwhat happens in space around is you tellit to space around each and everythingso there's space away or space over herethen for this widget also space awayyour space awarethen for this widget also space away orspace away upto use spacearound all of the widgets what happensin space between iseverythingis spaced between those widgets it's notaround it's not happening in both thedirection the space is not being leftfrom here and your both it's only beingleft from herehereso it's aroundso for the starting widget it's going tobe only here for the middle widget isgoing to be year and year and for theending widget it's only going to be fromhere that's what space around isor space between usspace around says to leave space aroundeverything space between says that heyleave space between everything I hopeEnglish makes sense you knowit's all in the English and then we havespace evenly what we requireit spaces evenly everything but to behonest face evenly doesn't look as goodas space around so I'm just going tokeep space around all rightnow you can use space evenly if you likethat design I like this much betterbecause there's much more spacing andmuch more clarity now the benefit ofusing main axis alignment and not usingpadding is if I have four widget let'ssay it automatically adjustsI don't have to add a padding to thefourth widget over here if I have afifth widgetyou see it automatically adjustsaccording to the conditions that's thegood thing about itbut anyways I only need three thingsgreat so I have our entire UI createdand it looks awesome in my opinion butif you see additional informationdoesn't have that much of height overhere this does have so you can reduce itto Heights to let's say eight and thiswill look better also for weatherforecast if you want todecrement this size you can go ahead anddecrement that let's say put 8and that will look better for youso yeah this is our UI design perfectnow to show you the column thing that Iwas talking about column has the samemain access alignment properties if youhave main access alignment dot start ordot space around let's say everything isspaced around in the entire screen firstwidget over here then spacing so thatspace aroundagain space around so this space aroundevery single widget hereif we have space betweenthe space between all of the widgets andit looks quite similar to space aroundthen we have space evenlythis also looks quite similar but thereis some changeso my point is you have the same stuffyou can do in Center everything getscentered but for me I want the defaultoption of main access alignment dotstart because that looks perfectgreatwhat I want to do is make sure thateverything can have a different value ofits own right now what we are doing issaying that hey additional info item isgoing to havehumidity text it's going to have thewater drop icon is going to have thisconstant text whenever you initializeadditional info item these are thethings that get createdunlike the design over here I cannot putwind speed I cannot put pressure Icannot put all of that stuffbecause whenever I create this widget wehave this stuff displayingSo to avoid that what I can do is takeeverything here from The Constructorwhy because every time you initialize 10you ask what the icon should be what thelabel should be what the value should beand that's exactly what we want we wantdifferent items for every time we createan additional info item so let's goahead and create a Constructor how do wecreate a Constructor nowwell first of all we Mark every widget afinal becauseit's a widget right and widget areimmutable especially stateless widgetand even stateful widgets are immutableall widgets are immutable so we need tohave final for all our properties sowe're going to have final I can databecause I can requires icon datathen we are going to ask for the iconand we are not going to initializeanything because if we initialize thenwe are itself giving it a value so itdoesn't make sense to put it over herewe can just put it over here we need toask it from The Constructor so we aregoing to have required because this is anamed argument we have learned it in Dotrequired this dot icon now I can takethis icon and pass it over here now yousee we get an error over here sayingthat whenever you initialize additionalinfo item you need to pass your own iconwe get an error over here also sayingthat hey you cannot put a constbecause this is coming from theConstructor and the value from TheConstructor can changeso this cannot be a constant it's adynamic value so let's put constant forthe size boxnow even for this text we need to takeit from theConstructor itself so let's take finalstring labelthen we have required this dot label soI can ask for label over hereagain this is dynamic so text constantis not requiredso any value that is coming from theConstructorcannot be a constantthen we need a value text so we have ynull string value required this dotvaluenow I can take this value and paste itover hereso textstring value is not is a is anon-constant but textile can still be aconstant rightso we can put a constant over heresimpleand now with this we have accessto all of these properties over here soevery time you initialize additionalinfo item you need to pass in theseparticular properties so let's go aheadand pass icons dot water drop as thefirst icon because our first thing isgoing to be humiditythen our label which is going to be yourmiddayand then finally the value which isgoing to belet's say in 91.and when we come over here well theerror gets a result now we need to do ittwo more times so our icon here labelhere and value here is required now whatis our labelwind speed so let's go ahead and typewind speed the icon for it is going tobe icons dot air becausethat's what wind isand then we are going to haveseven pointfive let's saythen again we have to mention I canlabelvalueso my value here is going to be let'ssay 1000pressureand I didn't find any particular iconfor pressureso what I did was go ahead and use iconsDotBeachsince I didn't find it if you haveanything related to pressure you can usethat but I like this much betterso you see everything has its own valuenow same thing we are going to do withthe weather forecast as wellhere in our Ali forecast item you'll seeevery time we initialize it gets its ownstatic values we need to pass it fromThe Constructor so that the values canchange every time we initialize so dothe exact same thingpause the video try it on your own and Ihope you're able to do it if you're ableto do it then congrats you've understoodthe entire concept if you're not thenmaybe you need to re-watch the entirethingso I hope you were able to do it let'sgo ahead and try it on your own andearly forecast icon item the first thingwe require is final stringtimethen we need finalstring temperaturethen final icon data iconnow we need to mention required for allbut I have a trick for you you can pressthis bulb icon add final fieldparameters and it automatically addsrequired Arguments for yougreat saves a lot of time for us let'sgo to the Ali forecast item and mentionit so we need to mention time time islet's say 0 0 firstthen we haveiconit will be icons dot let's say it'scloudbecause it's rainingthen thetemperature is going to bewhat's the temperature over here301.22 let's save it I'm going to pasteit four more times so one two three fourlet's remove themso this will be 0 3 let's call it sunnyand let's say it's275I hope 275 degree Fahrenheit is sunnyand I thinkif I think about it 275 degreesFahrenheit is quite a lot ofheat it's more than 100 degree celsiusso we are making a mistake here insteadof 300 degree Fahrenheit we need 300Kelvin that's what the correct thing isso I apologize and I know you might bethinkingall the time that hey this is incorrectit's not actually in degree Fahrenheitit's actually in kelvin I misinterpretedit so my bad so anyways uh let's go backto our stuff 275 is not at all Sunny solet's go ahead with300.52then 301.22 then302.22 let's call this sunny againwe have300.12 and finally304.12then also change the time zero threezero sixzero nineand twelveso yeah we are able to change everythinglet's also puteverything over here so time over hereis going to be timeI can here is going to be icon andthe text here is going to be temperatureconstantlet's put everywhereconstant now if you're wondering how Iselected multiple cursors at a time Idid that by pressing option so when youselect one place put option on anotherput option on another and then you'reable to do it that's how I do it on MacI'm not sure about Windows but you canGoogle itokay now let's restart it and there wehave itthat's our app perfect now again Iapologize and you know I had beenthinking it wrong it's not actuallydegree Fahrenheit it's Kelvin because itmakes more sense degree Fahrenheit wouldmean that this is like over 100 degreesCelsius and that just doesn't make senseright so this is Kelvin which basicallymeans that it's 27 degrees CelsiusAlso let's correct the spelling ofhumidity thereOkay cool so yeah we are done with thebasic structure of the app now the nextthing is to get data from APIfrom the web so that I can display it onmy screen real timeand we also need proper loadingindicators we need proper errorindicators all of those stuff so let'sgo ahead and set it up so to get thereal-time data we need access to an APIand to call an API we will need the HTTPpackage we've already seen that in thedart sectionso let's go ahead and install the HTTPPlugin or package to our flutter code indot pad it was available for us but herein flutter when we are on our localsystem we have to install it so we needto go to pubspect.aml in thedependencies section we need to add thatdependencyAlso let's get the HTTP version nowwe have pub.dev packages HTTP where youcan find the HTTP Plugin or a packagethen you can just copy it paste it overhere save it and then it will runflutter pop get command flood up up getcommand gets all the dependencies all ofthe things that are mentioned over herewe'll see fonts assets everythingand then it refreshes our projectnow we'll be able to use the HTTP pluginin our code so let's go ahead right atthe top and we are going to create ourfunction over here and that is going toreturn a futureand let's call this function get currentweatherwe can Define functions in a statelesswidget that's not not allowed you candefinitely do it so let's put async overand we already know how to put HTTPcalls it's all given over here firstthing is to import it andto refresh your memory as HTTP is givenyou becausewe don't want to call just get functionlike this which is present in http.dotfile which you can come over here andseeso we are using HTTP dot getthis makes it easy then it requiressomething known as an URI andto pass a URI you can just do uri.parseor UI dot httpseither of them work but I'm going to goahead with uri.pass because I alreadyhave the URL it's going to give menow if you're wondering what URI is URIstands for uniform resource identifierURL stands for uniform resource locatorthe difference between URI and URL isthat URL is a subtype of URI URI has aparticular scheme which is followed byURL as wellbut URI is like a bigger set and URL isa subset of itso let's go ahead and pass our URL hereandhow do we get our URLwell to get it we have to access the APIand the API we're going to use is givenby open weather map in dot section weare to use Json placeholder that wasjust a dummy and a fake mock API allright this is the real API it's givingus real dataso what will be the temperature inLondon Mumbai England New YorkEtc so how do we get access to its APIwell first of all I'd like to mentionthat there are multiple websites thatoffer apis for weather but I like openWeather the best because it offers afree API that everyone can use it alsohas a paid version foradvanced stuff but for usthe free API is enough all rightso what you need to do is go ahead clickon sign in then you need to create anaccount first so let's go ahead andcreate an account my name is I'll entermy email password repeat password clickon these two things and the captcha andcreate an accountand I'll see you after I do these stepsso I'll check my email I'll confirm itand you see they've sent a verificationemail then just click on verify youremailand this email address has beensuccessfully confirmednow what we need to do is wait foranother email open whether team willsend us which will contain our API keyit will contain the URL we can use forfree in our projects so let's wait forit or if you don't want to wait for ityou can click over here my API keys andyou'll see your API key don't use minebecause I'm just going to deactivatethis after this tutorial kindly use yourown API key and you'll also see overhere that the email has arrived and itcontains my API keyand it says within the next couple ofhours it will be activated and ready touse if I use it right now there's apossibility that I won't be able to useit and it will give me an error howeverI can do it later on and I can alsocreate more API keys on my account pagewhich we've already seen over here I cangenerate more API keysandit says to always use the API key ineach API call now you might ask hey whydo we need API keythe Json placeholder didn't have API keyright well it didn't have it because itwas a mocked data it was a dummy data itdoesn't have any real valuebut this is real-time data it containsactual dataof the weatherandsome usermight call this API like a hundredthousand times a million times by justusing a simple for Loop that means theAPI will be called a million times sothat will cost the companya lotand the company obviously doesn't wantthatthat's why API keys are there so thatthey can authenticate youthey know that it's you who are usingand they can put trade limits to howmuchtimes you can call it for our URL overhere we have I think1000 free API calls and after that itwill stop working for usso let's go ahead copy this URLput https colon slash slashput this thing over hereand save itlet's break the this URL down and seewhat all it contains first one httpswhich I had to add then API dotopenweathermap.org slash data 2.5 thisis like their model if you're familiarwith chart GPDit also isworking on certain models right it isworking on 3.5 modelthis is the 2.5 model open weather maps2.5 modelthe three model isa subscribe versionI'll show it to you over here if you gotoopen Weather APIyou see one call Api 3.0and it has minute forecast Ali forecastdaily forecast it has a lot more stuffthan a simple API cool then we haveweather because we want the weatheryou're just having the path then youhave question mark Q is equal to Londonmost of the interesting stuff happensafter the question mark where you canchange it because this is what is knownas querieseven if you go to Google after thequestion mark you'll see the cool stuffthe stuff you can change so we havequestion mark Q as equal to London sothis is basically this place name youwant to get the weather off so we cantake this out and put it in a variableof our own let's call this London overherelet's take the city name and put DollarCity name like thisthen we have comma UK it's just tellingLondon comma UK this is where I want toget the weather off then we have app IDand this is our app ID Now app IDs needto be stored in dot EnV file which canbe hidden byget ignore and even when you want todeploy your website but assuming you'renot going to deploy this website let'sput it in a separate file of its ownwhich you can ignore if you're pushingto GitHub now if you don't know whatGitHub means don't worry about it justsave it in a different file let's goahead and call thissecrets.and here I'm going to have constantopen whetherAPI key which is equal to this timenow we'll copy this come over here andhave Dollar open Weather API key alsopress command full stop to import theparticular secrets.filelet's see if this much and let's seewhat we get let's put a weight here wealready know the protocol let's havefinal result is equal to this then weare going to have print result dot bodybecause I just want to see what all itgives meand now if I restart I see absolutelynothing why because this function is notcalledwe need to call it somewhere right wecan go ahead and call this in buildfunction but I already told you beforethat build function needs to bekept away from asynchronous stuffand I've also mentioned the reasonbeforebuild function should always be theleast expensive so you can you shouldnot call this function in the buildfunction so what should we dowell we can do one thing we can convertthe stateless widget to a statefulwidget then use the init State methodand then we can call this particularfunction over there right that soundsreasonableso to create a stateful widget we'llhave to do stf L and create a statefulwidget right not reallythe dart and flutter extension is quitegenerous with this you can just pressCtrl shift ryou get the options to change stuff andyou have convert to stateful widget ifyou just click on it it will make theappropriate changes and convert it to astateful widget without giving any errorso our stateless widget is Now statefulwidget with just one click and ourmethod is also defined over herecorrectly not inside of the statefulwidgetclass it's correctly defined inside ofthis classnow let's go ahead and create nth statethe super.net state should always be atthe topthen we have get current weathersave it command Jand you see as soon as we reload itgives us an error if we restart it willagain give us an error the reason forthis is401 error 401 error stands for badrequestas you already know 404 stands forpage not found so four zero four isso four zero one is there so thatyou see that it's a bad request and amessage is also provided for furthercontext saying invalid API key pleasesee this thing for more infonow if I click over here open ityou see API calls return on error 401and these are the possible things that'swhy it gave us an error you did notspecify your API key we did your API keyis not activated yet next couple ofhours it will be activated and ready touse so this is a problemrest of the things are fine we are usingthe free subscription we are not usingthe wrong API key and only we have notwaited for the uh for a couple of hoursso I'll see you after a couple of hourswhen our API key is activated and we canuse it so I'm back after three hours andthe data is now coming we have all thedata we require to display it on thescreen so now let's just understand whatis useful for us and what is not so thatwe can only include parts that areuseful to us and extract them right sothe first thing that we require is wellI just want to take this and put it insome form ofvisualizer where I can properly see thedata so what I'm going to do is copythis URL go to Google Chrome paste itand obviously we need to pass in somestuff like the city name should beLondon the app ID should be present solet's go ahead and pass in the app IDwhich is present in secretsand when I press enter I see all thestuff that I require rightnow if you see this data this data isgiving methe weatherthe main temperature so I'm getting whatthe temperature right now in London isand I'm getting wind speed and all ofthat stuff but I'm not getting theforecast and that's because we have usedthe wrong APIthe API we should be using is not data2.5 weather because this will give usthe weather I want forecast so I'll justgo ahead and pass in forecast here andI'll be able to get the forecast ofthe weather you see this list has 40items and if you're wondering how I'mhaving this Json inthis format it's because of an extensionand the extension name is Json formattoall right now you see we have a listthat returns 40 items and in every listwe have an object and in this object ora map we are getting the temperaturethen we are getting theweather name that we require in our appover herethen we have the pressure humidityall of that stuff right so we need touse the forecast wire andusing this we can extract the dataso what is the data we require wellfirst of allI want to check if it's a status code of200 or not the status code of 200basically says that hey this request issuccessfulotherwise we get a status code of 401which was like bad request so yeah firstof all I want to make sure that it's acorrect requestalso I want to try it in awrap it in a try and catch block solet's go ahead have try catch blockthen we have through e.2 string I've nottalked about throw in the dot sectionbecause I wanted to specifically show itover here what through does is basicallylike if you want to return somethingfrom a functionand suddenly you encounter an error soyou just throw that error you're sayingthat this function when it was calleddid not give any result it resulted inan errorand that means your app will crash if itis not handledso I'm just throwing the error that heyI received an error just take it anddisplay it on the screen or do whateveryou want so we need to correctly handlethis throw all rightotherwiseour app will breakthe next thing I want to do here isfirst of all check the status code ifit's 200 or not so for this I can doif response dot status code is equalequal to 200 this is one way of doing itthe other way of doing it is taking thestatus code that they've mentioned overhereso first of all we'll have to decode theresponse dot body because it is in astring format we already saw that in thedot section so we have json.json decodeput it in rest dot body save itand also you see as soon as I importJson decode dot convert gets importednowyou can see Json decode required astring source so we have passed andresponse to our body it returns adynamic so what I want to do is finaldata is equal to Json decodeand after I have the data with meI can just check ifdata at COD that's what it's calledright Codis not equal to 200 and I'm putting itin strings over here because Cod returnsto as a stringrightthe alternative to this could beconverting this to an integerso you could go ahead and do n dot parsewhat we have learned beforeto convert from string to an integer andthen you can check is not equal to 200like this both of these things work youcan use whatever B you prefer and thatwill work fine all rightso let's go ahead with this part righthereso if the status code is not 200 thatmeans some error occurred if some erroroccurred then we again want to throwsaying an unexpected error occurredI hope you're understanding what throwmeans I mean of course you won'tunderstand it right now but when we callthe functionit will basically throw you an exceptionsaying that hey there is an unhandledexceptionsaying that an unexpected error occurredall right and in the else condition oryou can just have it over here no needof health condition because throughbasically returns from the function itdoesn't execute any further just likereturn does all rightso if you put through hereit will terminate the function at thispoint it won't go any furtherand finally what I'm going to do isprint dataat and the thing I want to print is thetemperature wire so we are going to havedata which gives us this thingdata at least so with list I'll accessthis thing so I'll have data at list andsince it's a list I will access thezeroth element on it to get the firstprediction or the First Data stuffso here I have itand I'll do listed 0 then I'm going tohave Mainand after that I'm going to havetemperatureokayso list at 0 which is the first map thenwe have Main and then we are accessingthe temperature so that should give uslet's say 291.8 or something similarlet's go over here let's restart the appand we do 3290 1.65 so we weresuccessful in retrieving the correctstuffs now we just want to display it onthe screen right I want to display itover here how can I display this thingover here it's enclosed in a functionright so what I can do is create aglobal variable let's call thisdouble temperaturewhich is equal to let's say 0 initiallyor you might be tempted to use latedouble because we are assigning thevalue late right so this should workbut let's see if it actually works I'mgoing to set temperature equal to thisokay and now I'm going to passtemperature over here so I'm going tohave dollar temperature kso it gives me 291.12 Kelvin now I'malso going to remove constant let's putthe correct constants everywhereagain I'm pressing option to selectmultiple cursors and put constant coollet's come back over here and you seelate initialization error field temp hasnot been initialized let's restart itmaybe that works not really this doesn'twork why becauseif we come over here we get currentweatherthis thing runs before the buildfunctionand that's coolbut what if I do printbuild function or let's call this initstatethen I'm going to print this statementagain over herefunction calledthen I'm going to print after this APIcall all right after this API call I'mgoing to I have API ended all rightand finally I'm going to have a printstatement saying buildfunction callednow let's openby using command J restart and you seeover here init statewe have in its data wherethen we have function called and then wedirectly have build function calledso it skipped this partbut earlier we printed this value and itgot printed correctly right then why isit giving an error right now well that'sbecausewhat you're doing is assigning this tolate late basically means thatyou have a contract you need to assignit before the build function is calledif you're using it obviously in thebuild function if you're not using it inthe build functionlate doesn't really carebut if you're using it somewhereit will start to careso what happens is late doubletemperature then you are having in itsstate then you have get current weatherthis function gets called and this APIcall is there now this API call is goingto take time right you're retrievingsome data from the web that will taketime depending on your internetconnectionbut while it is waiting we have alreadyexecuted the build function becausethat's how asynchronous stuff worksit won't wait for it to complete it justsaid hey just complete this in thefutureI'll just go ahead and do my stuff so itcalled the build function and here whenthe build function was called you alsocalled The Late variable temperaturewhich hasn't been initializedthat's the problemso what should we do thenwhat is the fixed aware well first ofall let's just remove all the printcallsI don't like seeing warnings that muchunless there are constant warningsso we are back to normal now so onepossible fix here is having doubletemperature is equal to zero as soon aswe do that press command Jrestart the app come over here we get0.0 Kelvin again the value is notinitialized what is the other casewell that's the case becauseyou againset this to zero then you have getcurrent weather it is getting the datain the background let's sayand in the meantime it also called thebuild function if it called the buildfunction it already used the value oftemperature given to it which was zeroand later on when the value arrivedthe build function was already ready anddisplaying it but then you said hey settemperature equal to this thing overhere so you're reassigning the valueafter the build function is called it'sas good as calling a function afterontapso my point is you just need to wrap itwith a set stateif you do such State what will happen iswhen you restartyou see 0 and then it converts to 291.65because initially the value is 0 thenit's retrieving the value in themeantime you'll show the value of 0over here and then you finally got thevalue of temperaturewhich you have assigned and then youcall such state to rebuild the buildfunction and that wayyou get291.65 Kelvinso I hope that made sense to you if itdid not ask me in the comment sectionand I'll explain it to you again butanyways if we again restart the app thisdoes not look good it's not a good userexperience to show zero Kelvin firstthen show291.65 Kelvinit's just not a good experience so whatI want to show instead is a loadingindicator so aslong as this function is loading and weare getting a data we are just going tokeep loading the screenso I'm just going to replace this bodypart with a circular progress indicatorinstead as long as as it's loading allright so this all will disappear andonly a loading indicator will show upso let's go ahead and have a body herenow how do I show a loading indicatorhere well the first approach is to usethe temperature and have if temperatureis equal to zerothen we can usea loading indicator now what is thewidget for loading indicator well it'sjustprogress indicator and you can have twotypes of progress indicator or threetypesI don't know but you can have leanerprogress indicator refresh progressindicator circular progress indicatorthe one I like the most is circularprogress indicator however go ahead andtry linear progress indicator andrefresh progress indicator for yourselfI'm going to go ahead with circularprogress indicator now I'm also going tohave Constable air the reason I'm doingtemperature is equal equal to 0is because the temperature can never bezero Kelvinif it's zero Kelvin then we are freezingit's absolute temperature right that'swhy if it was some other value Iwouldn't put is equal equal to 0 becausesome other temperature can be attainedlet's say the initial value was270. I wouldn't dotemperature is equal equal to 270because temperature can be 270 Kelvinbut because temperature can be 270Kelvin when it is coming from this thingright heresome place might have a temperature of270 Kelvin but no place has atemperature ofzero Kelvin that's why I'm using it todisplay a circular progress indicatorhowever another option could be to useanother variable called Boolean isloading which is initially set to falsethen you come away you set State you setis loading to true so you're basicallytelling hey rebuild the build functionis loading is now truethen here you haveis loadingset to falseand you come down and you just haveis loadingif it's loading then show circularprogress indicator otherwise the paddingis fine now let's restartand you see we see a circular progressindicator in the left hand side and thenthis thingso that means our loading indicator isworking however if you use temperatureis equal equal to 0 as well it will workjust finelet's restartyou see 270 Kelvin not 270 Kelvin sorryI'll set it to 0I'll restart loading indicator is thereand then I see this thing over hereso I hope that made sense to younow you can use either of thoseapproaches it is on you but my pointright now is this is quite tedious to behonest I have to set up my own loadingindicators I have to set up my own errorhandlers for example if I just misspellin something in the API and then I startto run my function I'll see an error allright you see unhandle exception formatexception blah blah blah blahand it continuously keeps loadingbecause I haven't set up my it's loadingproperly in case of an error I have toset it to false even hereif there's an error I have to set asloading set to false so I have to do allof this stuff on my own and it's quitetedious for meluckily flutter has something for uslet's look at italsoyou see unhandled exception formatexception all of thatand if we use let's say data 3 over hereand then restartyou'll see unhandled exception andunexpected error occurred what we hadover hereso basically throw is just returning anexception for youand the error message can be whateveryou have written over here so I hopethat made sense to you what this throwdoes it basically throws an exceptionand whenever you have an unhandledexception you have to add a try and acatch block here and do stuff on yourown howeveryou have to put a try on catch blockhere let's have e over here and then youhave get current weatherthen whatever error it gives you justprint e all of that stuff you'll have todo it or just don't throw from herehowever my point is there's a lot ofstuff to do a lot of error handling todo insteadI can use something provided by flutterwhich willboost my performance by a lot so let'sremove energy State let's remove thisloading let's remove the temperature aswellall the set states are not requiredanymorewe can keep this line over here becausewe are going to extract the meantemperature again but not over hereand what we are going to do is justreturn data in case of a status code of200. now let's come over here let'sremove the loading indicator for nowand here again we're going to go back tothe static value however you alreadyknowconstants are not going to be neededanymore because we are all going to havea dynamic value so let's not useconstant because the value is going tokeep changing it's coming from an APIall right and what I'm going to do iswrap padding widget withanother widget and what is that widgetfutureBuilder this is a widget provided byflutter thateases our life by a lot when dealingwith Futures and if we want to displaysomething related to our futureso we're going to have a future we aregoing to have a builderthen we are going to have contextsnapshot I'll explain what snapshot isand we're going to have an RO functionreturned from a builder so these are tworequired arguments of future Builderquite convenient future and Builder nowI'll explain both of these things butlet's resolve the error we have onlyfuture so what is this future build upwell basically you just need to pass inyour future over here it can be anythingfuture of object and object is a superclass of everythingso you can pass any function over hereany variable that is a futureand it will build according to it so ifI go ahead and return my function whichis a futureso I'm going to have get current weatherand then let's just convert this to ablock all right I don't want an arrowfunction because I want to printsomething hereI cannot printfunction does not allow it it justallows me to return one thing if I justconvert it to a block I'll be able toprint it so press Ctrl shift R get therefactoring option and it asks you toconvert to block bodyso let's convert itsave it it will format let's go rightover here and we are going to printsnapshot what exactly is this snapshotalso we're going to print the runtimetype of the snapshotso press command Jwe're going to restartand we see something like async snapshotDynamic connection state DOT weightingasync snapshot Dynamic so this is theruntime type then we have our entirevalue coming and A6 snapshot dynamicso what is this thing over here wellsnapshot is basically a class thatallows you tohandle States in your app a loadingstatea data State an error State you canhandle all of that using async snapshotthat's what snapshot gives usyou see over your connection state DOTwaiting why did this connection stateDOT weight income because you weregetting data from the web so it's sayingthat hey we are still getting your datathen we have the runtime type because weprinted it and after a while it saidconnection state DOT done that hey wegot your data it's successfully thereandit printed it out to us this null nullnull stands for each and everything ifit's if it is having data if it ishaving error if it is having loadingwhat is it havingso that's what null null stands for overhereso anyways now that we understand thiswe can handle the loading State easilywe know whenever there's loading Statewe have connection State DOT waiting soif we have if snapshot Dotnow what do we use snapshot dot hashdata has error connection stateright because this might be an enum or aclass I don't knowand this requires a connection State aswell so I'm just going to have ifsnapshots dot connection state is equalto connection State DOT and it is anenum and it gives us values like activedone none waitingwhen it's loading it is giving uswaiting right so we can just use thatand returna circular progress indicator Also let'sreturn a constant over here perfect nowif I restart I see the loading indicatorand 200 Kelvin I again restart I seeloading indicator 200 Kelvinnow 200 Kelvin is not the correct valueit's hard coded but you see we aregetting the loading indicator and thenour data so we don't have to handle allof the stuff on our own if there's errorwe can print it how we can just have ifsnapshot dot has errorif snapshot has error then we are goingto return constant text saying snapshotdot Arrow which is an object all rightand this can't be a constant becausesnapshot dot erroris a dynamic value it's coming fromsnapshot right it's not a static valueit's not a hard-coded value or aconstant value so we need to returntext Dot to string because text cannottake an object it has to take in astringso we return an errorall rightso if snapshot has zero that means ifthe async snapshot has error then wejust want a text to show the error onthe screenand what return will do is basicallyjust return this text from here it willnot display anything from here andthat's exactly what we want in case oferror just display it to the user don'tdisplay wrong values that's not how ourapp works let's get rid of snapshotlet's save this restart we have aloading indicator and there's no errorso it doesn't show anything however if Ijust take thisnot take this if I spell thisincorrectly let's saydata 3let's restart the app you see loadingindicator and then an unexpected erroroccurred that's a good signnow if you want to return a differentkind of message you can do that you canhave datamessage because with every code which isnot 200 we get a message as well when wehad four zero one we had a message aswell you see internal error shows up nowthat's what the error saysif here I type in data atthree forecast it says internal errorand the code is 404 are favored notfoundso let's come back to our 2.5 model evenhere 2.5 modelI think I'm going to keep an unexpectederror occurred that's a better messagethan whatever the API might give uscool so now we are able to handle theloading indicator and the error messagenow let's style it a little bit becausethe loading indicator is showing rightin the left hand side corner so let'sCenter it to center it Ctrl shift rthen wrap it with Center you all areexperts in this now you can just pass inconstantand now a loading indicator will becentered perfectI still have some problem with itif I restart it's showing a materialdesignloading indicator on an iOS simulatorwhat I want to do is show this kind oficonor this kind of loading indicator onlyon Android devices not on iOS devicesthat's why what I'm going to do is usecircular progress indicator dot adaptivewith adaptiveit changes based onthe operating system it's on so if it'son iOS it gives a iOS kind of indicatorand if we open a pixel it will give usthe material designprogress indicator and that's reallycool it just gives us a native feelnow if you want to use circular progressindicator you can use it I just wantedto show this cool thing to youalso this text can be centered so let'sgo ahead and wrap it with Center sweetnowwe have handled the loading State wehave handled the error State and finallywe are on the data state so let's goahead and retrieve our data for ourfirst data we have already implementedthe logic for it so let's just copy thatso here we're going to have final datawhich is equal tosnapshot.data and this data can benullable all rightso we are just going to apply here thathey the data here is never going to benullable alsoI've already mentioned this to youbefore whenever we return future oranything like stream future always makesure that you have a generic typebecause future Dynamic isn't cool we'vediscussed this in dot courseso what I want to do is return a futureof some type and here I'm going toreturn data but what is the data well itis a map because at the end of the daywe are getting an object of stringso everything over here is a string inthe left hand side all the keys arestringsbut on the right hand side sometimes itis integer sometimes it is stringso we can just have future of map ofstring comma dynamicso here the dynamic is necessary becausestuff keeps changing on the value sideon the right hand sidecool now if you come over hereyou seesnapshot.data has a value of map stringcomma Dynamic with a nullable optionfirst of all future Builder is correctlyable to identify based on the future weprovided over hereand secondly this is nullable why isthis nullable because it thinks that itmight not have an error why does thishave a nullable option because it thinksthat maybe there's an error maybethere's loading state it cannotdefinitely have a value that's why it isnullable but now since we have handledthe error State and we have handled theloading statewe are quite sure that it is going tohave a valueotherwise you can just check it on yourown if snapshot dot has data what hasdata does behind the scenes is justcheck if data is not null it's basicallychecking if data is not equal to nullthat is what snapshot.house data is andsame goes for has error error is notequal to nullokayyou can do that but here I'm quiteconfident it is going to have data nowI'm going to have final currentweathertemperatureor let's just say current temperaturebecause we are also having forecastright if there's forecast there's apossibility of havinglater values as well so that won't becurrent temperatureso we're going to final currenttemperature and we're going to set it todata list 0 main temperature which wasour main temperature or the currenttemperature that we want to showand finally we are going to come backhere and type dollar current temperatureKelvin restartand with the loading indicator we getthe right value perfect so the firstpart of our app is complete congrats tousnow let's go ahead and change this iconand this text based on what we get sothis icon over here is based on the textright if it's sunny I want to show a sunif it's rain cloud whatever I want toshowa cloud iconand for that we have a value in our listwhich is weather meanso what I need to do isfinal currentwhat do we call thiscurrent Sky because it is telling me howthe sky is cloudy whateverso let's call this current skyand then we are going to have data atlist at 0same thing as before data list 0then we're going to have weather insteadof Mainand then we are going to have the maincool now we can take this current skyand paste it over hereso you're going to havecurrent sky like this and it's going tobe a string all rightbecause main cloudsthis is a stringso save it put it as constant come backover hereand it gives us an error why because thetype string is not a subtype of type intof index let's see why we get this errorand the reason for this erroris if you come over here weather is alist we neglected thatwe directly said hey data listed 0whetheris a list and what we are saying iscalledthe main property on a list the listcannot have a main propertyonly maps have that only objects havethat so first we need to access thisparticular array and after that we canaccess main property on it so here weneed to do whether at zero so we iterateor we grab the first element of the listand then we call the main method on itor the main property on it and when youcome over here clouds are seenperfectnow you see we are repeating stuff overhere data at less zero so what I can dois shift this in another variable so Ican have final current weather datais equal to data listed 0because technically this currentthis consists of current weather dataand now I can replace it with thisnow this is just an improvement so thatyou know you have better readability inyour functions or in your classes or inyour UI codeand you don't have to repeat this stuffagain and again data list 0.you just store it in a variable and youcan use it anywhere now I'm going totake this current Sky I'm going togo down remove constant from icon andhere I'm going to have if current sky isequal to either cloudor current sky is equal equal to drainthose are two possibilities all rightand you can put or condition ina ternary operatorso if it's either of them then we wantto display icons dot Cloud otherwiseicons dot sunnynow if we come back over here we areseeinga sun and that's becausethe data we are getting is clouds notCloud so we need to make sure this isthe correct thing and you know make surethe case sensitivity is also correctclouds is not equal toCapital C clouds all right so make sureeverything is correct you come back overhere and you see clouds perfect so thispart over here is done now let's move toadditional information and after that wecan get to the weather forecastso in additional information we havehumidity and I've spelled that wrongeven after trying to correct itlet's go ahead and type it over herenow let's get let's get the values ofhumidity when speed and pressure let'sexplore the API to see if the it hasvalues and I'm just going to grab thisfirstcurrent weather because that should givemethe wind speed the pressure all of thatstuff I should not be going to thesecond element of this list because thatcontains the prediction for later onit's not the prediction as of right nowyou seeit has a prediction of some other timethis is the current predictionso to access pressure we have this thingover here which is present in main we'vealready done this before so let's goright at the topwe are going to have finalcurrent pressureyou want to type current you can type itor pressure because you have only onepressure in our entire app which is thecurrent pressureand set that equal to well the currentweather data so you can havecurrent weather dataso you're act already over here then youhave to access main pressureso you have Mainpressurecool now take this mean pressure go downin additional info item you see thisthing over herethis is this is where you can easily gofrom top to the bottom you don't have toscroll through stuff you can directlyjust jump from year to yearand it just saves a lot of time for meso get used to this and it will save youa bunch of timeespecially in bigger code basesso we are over here nowthe value is going to be 91 but in ourcasenot 91 sorry it's not humidity it'spressurein our case we need to mention a stringbut here it's giving us a numberall rightall the numbers are marked in bluestrings are marked and greenso it's giving us a number so maybe wecan have current pressure dot two stringwith two string we are able to only getthe required pressure Also let's removeconstant from here we all know it's notgoing to be a constantlet's save it come back over here andthe pressure is one zero one one perfectthe next thing we require is wind speedhow do I get wind speed well it'spresent over here in wind speedso same thing we'll go over hereand Define a variable now obviously youcan copy this andgo down paste it over here and that willwork fine for you there's no problemwith it but when you have variables inone centralized place in my opinion itjust gets so much easier because if youwant to change anything you can changeall the API related stuff in one placeso let's come back to current wind speedand that is going to be windspeed because we are aware data at leastis 0 this thing over here then we aregoing to wind then speed and we'regetting the valuewe can copy this go downthen I have current wind speed dot twostring againsave it come over here we have 4.45 asour speed perfectand the last thing we require ishumidity and humidity is also present inthe same place as our pressureso let's go to current pressure now ifyou press command on our currentpressure variable you'll be able to gowhere the current pressure variable isdefined just like we can do withliterally anything right if you want togo to sized box you can click it overhere and we go to the flutter sourcecodeif you want to do that in your ownsource code you can do that as well soyou go to current pressure now I'm goingto copy this paste it againand now I'm going to have currenthumidity now I know I'm going a bitfaster here and I'm doing that becausethis is all the stuff we have covered inthe dot course just knowing what to usewhen to use I want to waste much timeover here right so yeah main humiditywe'll take this current humidity andpaste it over here and again pass twostring to it because it's a numbercome back over here and our humidity 48is showing all goodthe last thing we want to do is weatherforecast and that too for only fiveitems you see in our API it gives us alist of 40 items the first one we'vealready used so we are not going to useit again our numbering is now going tostart from 1.because 0 was used to display thecurrent weather now everything from hereis going to display the weather forecastso let's go to ourweather forecast over here earlyforecast item let's call this earlyforecast instead of weather forecast allright that that makes more sense I guessnow how do we handle thisI want to iterate through a listwhich is a listget five elementsand display them on the screenthat's a major after task to do heredo you know how you'll do ittry to do it on your own if you can andyou'll be more confident if you do itbut if you're not then I'll let you knowyou can think about using a for Loop allright when you use a for Looplet's remove a constantwhenever you use a for Loopyou can go from index one to index fiveand display it on the screenso let's try it what I'm going to do isforint I is equal to 1 because I want mylist to start from one I cannot startfrom 0 or I can start from zero entireis equal to 0 I is less than5 because I only want five elements Iplus plusthen I'm going to have my Ali forecastitemI'm going to remove the rest of theearly forecast itemsand first of all we require a Time nowwhere is the time mentioned in our listit's mentioned over here DT underscoretxt in this formatwe'll get to the date format part lateron we only want to get time but it'sgiving us date and time both but we'llget to it later on as of now let's justdisplaythe entire thing even if we getthe render flow error the error thatshows up in the yellow saying that theheight is extended like we saw over herewith our row when we are not wrapped itwith single child scroll view rememberthatif we remove this widgetyou see this error this is render flowerror and we will get that ifwe exceed the size already allotted to aparticular widgetso anywaysumlet's get access to the list so it'sgoing to be data at listso it's going to be data at least at Inot zero not one not anything but if weput I we get I is equal to 0 so thatmeans data at least it's 0 that meansyou are getting the same valueinstead I'm going to do data at least atI plus 1 with I plus 1 I get thestarting value as 1 till5 including 5 all right so we'll get thecorrect stuffso we'll get elements from 1or elements one two three four fivethat sounds good and once we are overhere let's say we are aware perfect sofirst of all I'm just going to print thedate time or the date and you can do twothings for it DT which gives you dateand let's say I think milliseconds sinceEpoch now what is Epoch Epoch is January1 1970so how many milliseconds have passedsince January 1 1970 this is what thedaytime isand in textthis is what it represents third July2023 12 amso you can use either of them I'm goingto go ahead and use DT for now later onI'm going to use DT textso that I can format it according to theway I want and if I come over here weget type int is not a type of stringbecause time requires string so let'sconvert it to a string and then pass itin and we have this thing over here andit keeps changing for everythingwe have one six eight eight three fourto four hundred one six eight eightthree five three two hundred all rightso I hope you get the pointthen we can have the same thing overheredata at least I plus 1main temperature so we're going to haveMaintempcome over here and it says type doubleis not a subtype of type stringbasically temperature is giving us adouble value temperature requires year astring value so call to string againcome back and you see 289.84287.855 and all of that stuff looks goodand finally we want to display thecorrect icon now to display the currenticon we have already put a logicand we know howto evaluate if it'sa good thing or notso what we need to do isgo at the top have current Sky scrollbackand we're just going to have if currentbe the weather data instead of currentweather data I'm going to have data atleast at I plus 1 right because currentweather data is data at least at zeroinstead of having zero here I'm having Iplus one I hope you're following alongso you have data at least I plus 1then main then temperature maintemperaturenot mean temperature sorryI plus 1 whether0 mean and if that is equal to clouds orif that exact thing is equal torain then we are going to have icons dotCloud otherwise I can start Sunny thenwe save itbecome aware and you see when we adda sunny weather we hadSunny icon showing upnow if we come back over here just toverify we are going to go over herewe'll seethat the main over here is clear and inclear we want to show Cloud no sun wedon't want to show clouds clouds is onlythere for rain and stuffokay so yeah we have been able to buildthe appthe problem here is what ifinstead of showing five things I want toshow 40 thingsexactly how muchthis allowsor 39 becauseor let's say 38and let's say I want to return or haveless than 39 items herethen what will happen well if I restartyou see we get a bunch of our iconsthose are all goodbut what's Happening Here is they arenot building on demand they are allbuilding together now we are getting ourweather forecast and that all is correctthat's all good that's perfect but theproblem here isn't about displaying andgetting the correct data it's about aperformance of the app all the widgetshere are building together that's a bigproblem when we are returning like 40widgets together right because it's like40 widgets are building together isn'tthat just insaneit will affect the performance of theapp very muchso instead of building 40 widgetstogether at the same time what I want todo is build this widgetjust when we scroll all rightso it lazily creates our widgets onlythe part that is scrolled will getcreated otherwise it won't get createdso it won't affect the performance ofour appI hope you understood this if not I'llrepeat you can skip if you understoodwhat I'm saying is 40 widgets are beingcreated together now that is a MajorPerformance thing because just imaginelike 40 components on the screentogether at the same time that's justmaking sure that your app performs lesswellso what I want to do is Implement kindof like lazy loading where the widgetsare being lazily loadednot the data we get the data as it isbut the widgets are being created ondemand as and when I scroll all right solike if I scroll like this the widgetshould get created not all at oncesofor this I'm just going to go ahead andcomment out the entire single childscroll Viewand I'm going to create my own earlyforecast from scratch using a widgetwhich is very very importantand that is called list view Buildersee this thing over here list viewBuilder there's another widget calledlist view which we haven't talked aboutand list view is basically like you knowif you want a column that is scrollableand you want tomention padding from the side you can goahead and list use list Viewit will help you over therewe are probably going to use list Viewlater on in a third appbutas of right now we're going to use listview dot Builderit requires a named argument of itemBuilder and it gives us context andindexalso one thing I think I forgot tomention is whenever you have for Loop ifconditions inside of flutter code youdon't have to mention bracketsI'm so sorry I forgot to mention thisbrackets are not required when you haveflutter codeyou can just mention for Loop no need ofbracket and if you want to return morethan justOne widget you can have dot dot dot anda listokayso what you're basically doing iswrapping all of them in a listand then you're destructuring the listso that everything shows upfor all the 40 Widgets or 39 widgets allrightso let's remove it we only want tohave one widget for Loopthat's why I'm just going to keep itlike this also let's comment it outagainand let's focus on our list view Buildernow listview Builder will build ondemand it accepts item Builder whichrequires a widget to be returned whichis nullable and it gives us buildcontextagain and an index now this index isthere becauseyou need to mention something known asan item count so this list view Builderis basically telling hey we'll help youto build a list of itemsthat are lazily loaded so it will getloaded as and when you scrollbut you need to mention the item counthow many items there are and the itemBuilder so what do you want to buildand for that we are giving you the indexbecause obviously if you mention theitem count let's say the item count isfive I am giving it a static valuehere we are not going to know what toreturn for example I'll return Ali carforecast item but then I have to mentiontime temperature iconnow how do I get access to time here wehad I I Plus 1. this is how I would knowI'm accessing one particular elementfrom the list how can I do it over herethat's why index is presentjust like there are four Loops Ithis is the index that will help usso let's go ahead get the data so we aregoing to haveour data Final early forecastwhich is equal to data at least indexplus one again we are going to have plusone because list view Builder alsostarts from zeroso we have our early forecast now thefirst thing that I want to return hereis DT which is the time so let's goahead and have DT dot to string which isjust time in two string then we havetemperature so we are going to haveearly forecastthen main thentemp and Dot to string and finally weare going to have our icons I'm justgoing to copy this line I'm not going totype it againand paste it over hereAlso let's uncomment this so touncomment it I'm going to press commandslashand there we goand finally I'm just going to take allof this out in one thingwhich is finalearly Sky let's call it thatthen we're going to have index plus 1and thenif Ali sky is equal to clouds or earlysky is equal to rainthen we are going to show the cloudotherwise sunnynow you can shift all of these variablesoutside as well so you're going to havefinal early temperature which is equalto this thinglet's paste it over here then we aregoing to have our date time which needsfurther factoring but as of right nowour list view Builder is complete whatwe are saying is build five items andthis is what you need to build build Aliforecast items five times and it willonly be visible as and when we scrollpress command J and we are received byerrors and a UI that doesn't look quitegoodlet's restartand still the UI is still dismantle Idon't know how it's looking like thisand we're getting a lot of Errors overherenow I'll simply tell you the reason youcan go ahead and read the errorsbut I'll tell you a simple reason forthislist view Builder has a tendency oftaking the entire screen sizelike you know our text field also hasthe tendency of taking the entire widthof the screen even less view Builder hasa tendency to take the entire screenand herewe cannot give it the entire screenobviously because we have this thingover here then we have our additionalinformation down belowso we have to restrict the heightto restrict the height we press Ctrlshift R wrap it with the sized box andgive it a height of 120.if we do that we are restricting theheight to one particular thing you seeand now we have our list which isscrollable and it only has a height of120.but still I want it to be like this likewe had before in the horizontalDirectionwe have a nice property for that in listview Builder which is scroll Directionjust like we had in a single childscroll view so we are going to pass inscroll Direction access dot horizontalsave it and when you come over here wehave met with an arrow and this error issolely there because we have setthe list view Builder's height so thislist view Builder entire thing itsheight is 120. and it is exceeding thecurrent heightwhich is why we are getting this errorand it's only there because this thingthis text is going down below that's notgoodso what we can do is restrict the textto only be there in one single line soif we go to our Ali forecast item widgetscroll down we have our text of time thetext has a property of Max lines ifyou'll seehere we can tell how many lines a textcan take maximum and it can only takemaximum of one line and you see theerror is resolved however it Clipsthings off and there is no notificationabout it like hey we clip this offthere's absolutely nothing told about itso we need to change that so for thattext and has another property which isOverflowso whenever it overflows it will justhave a certain style attached to it sowe have textoverflow Dot and it has clip let's seewhat clip looks likethe same thing as we had before dotEllipsis so this will give us dot dotdot which tells hey this is extendingthen we have text overflow dot fade soit will just fade in telling you hey wearecutting it offand then we have finallyvisible which is just completely visibleI like Ellipsis more because it justtells you that hey there's more to itbut we have dots over hereanyways now that we have our stuff goodour Ali focus is showing our app is nowworking based on our weather APIwe're almost done only differenceis the time that we want to showI told you we are not going to show DTwe are going to show DT underscore textwhich is not what it says it's DTunderscore txt not t EXT and we comeaway and we see 2023 all of that stuffnow what I want to do isof the entire date given I only want toaccess this particular thing only thelinesothink how will you be able to do itone possible suggestion would beto go ahead and use substring and Itotally agree you can go ahead and usesubstring because it is in the format ofyyyhyphenmm hyphen DDso it is going to have a particular setof characters after which you canextract your time and that works finefor meand maybe you want to use that but I'mgoing to take another approach which isto add a package to our app for thisand what is the package well if you goto pub.dev and type intl Intelyou'll see this package and this packageis published by dot team themselvessaying they provide internationalizationand localization facilities includingmessage translation and whatnotbut if you scroll downthey also help with number formattingthey also help fit date formatting andpassing which is exactly what we needwe have a date in a particular formatand we only want to display the timebased on thatso we can go ahead and add Intel to ourpubspect.aml file now instead of goingat the top copying Intel going toperspect.aml file scrolling downand in the dependencies adding Intellike this there's another thing you candonvs code press command shift pthen you have the property of adding dotadd dependency when you search for ityou'll see this and here you can justpass in the package name Intel and itwill automatically add it to public.amlfor you run flood up object runseverythingand you see Intel is automatically addedfor us so you can use this when you wantto add packages in Bunch for example Iwant to add let's say Intel I want toadd HTTP I want to add multiple things Ican separate them by comma and addeverythingbut since I've already added I'm goingto press escape to escape that dialogsweetso now that I have access todate formattinglet's go ahead and use it now you canrefer to the documentation that wasmentioned earlier but since I've used itbefore date format dot dot passI don't need reference to it butobviously if you're using it for thefirst time highly recommend to read thedocumentation that is attached over hereit will help you to use the packageefficiently and properlyso the first thing I want to do is takethis and convert it to a date timeobject now you remember in our DOT codeI had introduced you to date time dotnow like thisto demonstrate to you what finalvariables were right final time is equalto date time dot nowwell exactly we are going to convert itto date timethe string so the string is going to getconverted to date time which we can passusing Intel packageso we're going to have date time dotpass and whenever you have anything daterelated I always recommend to use datetime in Florida because it makes yourjob so much easierespecially when using it with the Intelit will make a lot of stuff easierfor example if you're building WhatsAppand you know on your home screen or inyour chat screen also in the chat bubbleyou see the text of the date asmentioned or the time is mentionedhow's that possiblehow can we do that in flutter wellexactly you can do it over hereso let's go ahead first of all andconvert it to date time so we have datetime dot pass and we need to pass in astring so we have early forecastDT underscore text and thenwe are going to use date format which isgiven to us by Intel package make sureit's imported right at the top intel.dotso we are going to update format Dotand we have multiple stuff over hereevery month abbr month day and all ofthat stuffbut here even down we have functions forthisthis is basically describing how youwant toformat your date time objectin my case what I want to do is displayit in a format like 0 0 or 3 or 6 or 9or 12 or 15 or 18 like that so for me Ican just use wireso for me I can just use date format.hmand then if I go to hm it basically justhas hm provided to ithm is basically R followed by minutewhich will give me in the format I wantare minute rightso we have date format.hm dot format andthen I'll pass time to it and formatrequires a date time which is why Iconverted this string to a date timeobjectall right now if I do thiscome back to the app I have 12 3 6 9 and12 showing upnow you can go ahead and try a bunch ofvariations here like HMS and you'll seeour minutes secondthen you'll haveJ let's say and you can try a bunch ofthings J is basically 12 am 3 AM 6 AM 9A.M 12 p.m whatever you prefer you canuse that and that will work for you orif you want your custom made you canjust update format and you can mentionyour own pattern here so if I mention hmyour it will again come back to me likethisor if I mention J like thisit will let me know like this so that'sthe pointthese functions were basically doingthat behind the scenes when you add dotj it was basically callingJ over hereso it was calling date formatat J what is this this refers to theclass itself this date format so youwere mentioning the pattern itselfso you had date format J dot format andthere we gonow we can save itrestart the app and I'm going to goahead with 12 am 3 am I like this betterand there we goso app is looking good now the lastfeature that I want is whenever I clickon this refresh icon it should refreshand if there's any update it should letthe user knowbecause obviously this is real time onlywhen we call it it's not like a streamthat will continuously Give us newupdates and new values when I click onrefresh it will refresh the screenso how do I make sure this refreshhappens Also let's remove the commentfrom here I hope you understand why wewant to use less view Builderit is a better approach overall lazyloading and all of that stuffnow if become aware in our icon buttonwhat if I just put such dateif I put set State what will happen iswhen I refreshit will rebuild the entire scaffold sothat means it will rebuild this entirefuture Builder as well it will call theget current weather function as wellthat means this entire build function isgoing to get rebuilthoweverif you check out the flutter officialvideo on future Builder now what they'vedone and recommended to do is store thisin a variableso you'll have finalweather which is equal to get currentweatheror maybe something like this so you havelaidfuture map string comma dynamicweather then you have NH stateand once we add in its state we are justgoing to set a late variable whetherequal toget current weather all right now I canuse this weather over here instead ofweather all right and now you seethe app loads now you might say hey whyis this not lazy loading and that'sbecausethis is having the type of future we arenot resolving the future we are notusing a weighted await anywhere ifyou're not using a weight anywhere weare just saying hey call this functionstore the future inside of this variableand then we are calling this variableand when I restart it doesn't give methe errornow when I restart or refresh thisdoesn't work anymore whybecause we are not calling the functionanymore we're calling the variable andwhen we call the variable it is notrebuilding again you see so earlier wehad a function and whenever the buildbuild function would rebuild thisfunction would get calledand that is why such State workedearlier when such state was calledentire build function was rebuilt sofuture Builder was also rebuilt so thisfuture was called the function wascalled and when it is called this thingre-ran and thus we got new values whichwere then updatedhowever herewe've already called the function overhereokay and the value is present inside ofweatherand we are just passing the weathervariable here so when such state iscalled build function is rebuilt thisweather variable is already there withthe value assigned to it bythe function that was called over hereso the function is not getting calledagain because such State doesn't call inits state again it just calls theweather variable and whether variablehas the type of future map stringDynamic and future Builder is justresolving that future giving us asnapshot so that we can use the dataerror loading and display it on thescreenthat's the job of future Builder butsince there was no function function wasnot called it was a variable andvariable already has a value assigned toit it has a value of future map stringDynamic assigned to itthat's why it is not getting rebuilt thefunction is not getting called againand thus it is not restarting andflutter always says to useit like this but in our casewe can call get current weather becausewe want it to work that way whenever thebuild function is called it shouldrebuild or what you can do isre-initialize weatherto get current weatherso if we search State whether is equalto get current weather that means we arere-initializing whetherso if we restart we come over here itwill again rebuild for the entire thingso as of now in a simple app there's nodifference betweenthis thing over here or just calling getcurrent weather and not having this it'sthe same thingbut in a bigger app when we get intoinherited widget which is in our thirdapp itselfand when we talk about State Managementyou'll see this build function will getcalled even whensuch state is not calledbecause that's the talk about StateManagement even such state is a kind ofstate of management now I hope yourunderstanding what state management isyou know what status and we just have tomanage the state so such state is alsotype of State Management but it isrelated to one single screen just likescaffold you knowscaffold is there for one single pageset state is there for one singlestateful widget it cannot manage thestate intwo to three different screenssuch state will only rebuild oneparticular screen it won't go ahead andrebuild a totally unrelated screen ifsome data changesthat's wherethings like inherited widget and we'regoing to study about riverpod comes inplacethis is just a local State Managementsolutionand the State Management we are going totalk about is global State Managementbut we'll get to it I hope youunderstood that this is local statemanagement but yeah we are going to divedeep into it because State Management isa very important conceptbut anyways you can use whatever I'mgoing to go ahead with the weatheroption because if you want to expand onthe app's functionalitiesand I hope you'll do that after you gainthe knowledge of State Management aswell and incorporate State Managementthat we learn in the third app over herethis will be more beneficial all rightso now let's getto the main.dot file againand here we have seen our app in darkmode Let's go ahead and use theme datadot lightif you use that let's see our app looksand this looks quite goodI'm not disappointed with the resultswe have our card we have everythingshowing up nicelylet's switch back to theme data.dog andthis looks nice if I use remove usematerial 3 to trueyou see this looks quite bad in myopinion the layout looks good thecoloring is not fine you know all theborders now haverectangular or pointy edges I don't likethat and if we just have dot lightlight doesn't look that bad I am alwaysfond of this color the blue color butstill it's not as good as compared tomaterial 3. all rightso that was the difference I wanted toshow you first Theory I want to talkabout is the layout Theory we've alreadyseen the Practical usage of this layoutbutsince we've already got a practicalexperience I want to give you atheoretical experience with it and afterthat we are going to talk about widgetTree Elementary and render objects thingthat I teased about when we werestarting with flutterand we're going to talk about whatexactly a widget isokaybut before that let's talk about layoutin theory the biggest quote in flutterin terms of layout is constraints godown sizes go up parent search positionwhat does this mean let's go over it oneby one the first sentence I said wasconstraints go down what does this meanit means that in flutter widgets receiveconstraints from their parent widgetsconstraints basically means boundariesso widgets receive their boundaries fromtheir parent widgets these boundariesDefine the limits within which a widgetcan render itselfeach widget passes these constraints orboundaries down to its child widgetswe've already seen a practicalexperience of it with our list viewBuilder and a lot more thingsif we had ourlist view Builder it was taking theentire screen sizewhat I said over here is wrap it with asize box give it a height of 120 so thatmeans constraints go downthe parent widget size box imposed arestriction a constrained a boundary onlist view Builderto take only this much height or thismuch space unless you build it the sameit gave its child widgets early forecastitem that particular constraints tostrainsince it couldn't stay it gave us arender flow error in the bottom youremember when the time we had DT overhere instead ofDT underscore txtso list view Builder passed it down toits children or childso that is what constraints go down meansecond thing is sizes go upthis means when a widget receivesconstraints from its parent itcalculates its own size based on thoseconstraintsthe widget tries to expand to fill theavailable space while respectingwhile respecting any limitations imposedby the constraints this process occursrecursively up the widget tree whereeach widget determines its size based onits children sizesand the constraints received from itsparent this thing is basically what Ihave just explained to you earlyforecast item took as much height asmuch width as listview Builder and sizebox restricted on itsince there was five right term countsit took this much spacesince there was access dot horizontal ittook this much space however when I putaccess dot vertical it takes the entirescreen size and it implements ascrolling view like thisall right so I hope you understood whatI meant over hereand the last thing here is parent setspositionso after determining the sizes of hischildrenthe parent widget decides where toposition each child Vision within itslayoutthe parent widget is responsible forarranging its children according to itsown layout rules and constraints this iswhat we did with the column rightI said we could wrap everything withalign widget we could wrap this textwith a line this text with a line thistext with the line this thing with aline and that would work but what I didinstead is in the column set crossaccess alignmentso that set the position for itschildren and its children wereeverything that you can seeall of these things are children ofcolumnso parent widget was responsible forarranging the children according totheir own layout rules and constraintsso I hope you understood thisthis is a theoretical aspectof itthe Practical I've already shown it toyou and we've implemented it in UInow you don't have to necessarilyremember it unless you're going forinterviews and stuffbut otherwise if you're just buildingfor yourself practical experience shouldbe enoughso nowwe are done with the applicationcompletely and I've also talked aboutlayout let's get into some moretheoretical Concepts which are quiteinteresting in my opinion so let's diveinto them now let's understand howflutter Works behind the scenes todisplay something on the UI or todisplay something on the screen so tounderstand this first we must know thatflutter doesn't really translate any ofthe widgets intoparticular native uis all right so ifyou have a buttonflutter isn't going to say hey you're aniOS platform let's convert this to aniOS native button if you're an Androidproduct isn't going to say hey you're onAndroid I'm going to convert it toAndroid native platform and then displayit on the screen noflutter doesn't translate to native codewhat flutter does is paint something onthe canvas usingits own rendering back end or renderingsystemthe rendering system it uses behind thescenes is this Kia Graphics engine whichis currently being replaced byimpellerthat's why if you come over here whenyou run your app and press command Jyou'll seeusing the impeller rendering backendbecause on iOS the work fortransitioning from this Kia Graphicsengine to impeller Graphics engine isdone on the Android it's still beingworking onand they'll cover it soonbut for iOS it is done the shift wasmade from skiato impeller because skiahad someissues with animation and3D stuff with impellerthings will be betterbut anywaysflutter doesn't translate to Native UIthat's why if you see over here I canhave an Android E look on iOSrightso this allows us to create customizableUI and we can have one UI in all ourplatforms irrespective of whether it isonAndroid iOS Mac OS webWindows whereverso now let's understand how stuff worksso first of all we have our widget treethe first thing that we have is thewidget tree and we already know whatwidget tree is right so let's get ithere type in widgettree and we know what widget tree is wehave already created our own widget treehere we have my app material app weatherscreen and in weather screen we havescaffold app baricon button future Builder progressindicator if there has to be onea text widget if there has to be one andall of that stuff if you want to take alook at the overall widget tree you canclick on this search kind of Icon overhereand this dialog will only show whenyou're running your app so thisDev tools widget inspector page willonly be there only when you run your appall right and now you see widget tree sothis tells you your entire widget treeyou can just push this down to see theentire thing so you have root my appmaterial app where the screen scaffoldeverything displayingand if you open this up a little bit youhave layout Explorer so you have toselect one widget and you'll get alayout Explorer for that particularthing so this is how your entire UIlooks likescreena scaffold which takes a width of 430a height of 932then you have future Builder which takesa width of 430 then it has a height of 8somethingthen you have padding which takessome constraints and that's what thelayout Explorer is all about you canexplore your layout how your layoutstuff is done then you have widgetdetails treewhere you can see the properties thatyou've used for every single widget beit padding column whateverone cool thing you'll notice over hereis something known as render objectand that's what our second or the thirdtree is all about so we have one moretree here so let's paste itand let's call this renderobjecttree all right so what is this renderobject tree we all know what widget treeis Right widget tree will represent thestructure of our UI and it is composedof multiple widgets but what exactly isa widgetwe know it is the block displaying it onthe screen but what is itwell a widget is just a configuration itis a lightweight object with finalpropertiesvia the properties final because widgetis immutable right and we've alreadyseen that whatever is immutable itsstate cannot change its properties ordata cannot changethat means widget tree is a verylightweight object that has only finalpropertiesto understandwhy widgets are immutablewe'll have to understand that widgettree doesn't really display anything onthe screen it is just there for you tocompose your UI to tell flutter how yourUI should look like flutter will manageall the rendering stuff behind thescenes you'll just tell how you wantyour stuff and it will do that behindthe scenesso widget doesn't actually renderanything let's just Chuck the widgettree and just focus on widget so let'sclose the widget inspector and we aregoing to just focus on one widget andunderstand it for all the widgetsand we are going to focus on the textwidget so text extends the statelesswidget right just like any other widgetit either extends stateless or statefulwidgetso what exactly does text return overherethe text returns something known as Richtext if you scroll down you'll find thebuild functionyou'll find default textile all of thosestuff if conditions then you have widgetresult is equal to Rich textthen you again have if conditions andthen you return resultso when there are no external propertieslike semantics label or registrar setupin your appwhat you return is a rich text so it issafe to assume that in normal conditionslike usRich Text is being written Now Rich Textis also a widget and I told you thatwidgets are just lightweight objectproperties and they don't renderanything so why are we returning a richtext well if we press command and go toRich Text source code you'll see whichtext doesn't really extend stateless orstateful widgetwhat it does extend is multi-childrender object widgetand multi-child render object widget isa widget to prove that you'll have to gointo the source code see that it extendsto render object widget go into thesource code and finally you'll see itextends a widget all rightso rich text is a widget but it doesn'textend stateless or stateful itextends multi-child render object widgetand that is what our tree is all aboutrender object 3.now render objects are of three typesor render object widget is of threetypes you can see it over herethe first type if you scroll down isleaf render object widget this is usedfor widgets that don't have any child orchildrenthen you have single child render objectwidgetthis is there for widgets that only haveone child like colored boxan example of leaf render object widgetis errorwidgetit doesn't have a child at all it justdisplays itselfan example of single child render objectwidget is colored box and then we havemulti-child render object widget whichis a column because it has multiplechildren rightso that is what render object widgetdoes thething that actually displays stuff onthe screen or renders stuff on thescreen is render object what renderobject does is it determines the sizeposition and visual representation ofthe widgets that we created or we haveand they handle tasks such as layoutcalculation painting pixels on thescreenso render object is the thing thatactually displays stuff on the screenand does that by calling methods likecreate render object and update renderobject so if you just go to the renderobject widget it is an abstract classright it has create render object and ithas update render objectso this is how it creates and updatesstuff on the screenso from what we have learned how stuffhappens is widget tree is there everyelement of the widget tree is traversedor it is iterated through or it has gonethroughand then a particular render objectwidget for it is created soit is safe to say that widget tree willtell render object tree to createsomething rightand that's partially true but what if wecall stuff like such datenow if I unnecessarily call such statein my app what will happenlet's say here I'm not calling weatherat all I just do such date I restart andwhen I click on refresh nothing reallyhappens the widget reads the samenothing additional gets printed on whyis that the case that's the case becausethere is one more tree in the middlewhich handles all of these things whichis the brain of whether render objecttree should rebuild or not and that isthe element treeso let's go ahead and create type andelement treeso this Elementary is a reflection ofwidget tree and is responsible formanaging the life cycle of widgetselements are created during the mountphase where theyencapsulate the corresponding widgetsand store mutable stateso basically widget tree goes andcreates a particular element for itand to understand this again let's divein the source code let's go to text dotdot where our Rich text wasand actually let's just exit both ofthem and I'm just going to go in thedefinition ofstateless widget so let's go over therebecause it's easier to understand thereyou see you have stateless widget andthen an override of stateless elementcreate element stateless element soevery widget that is there if you go tothe widgets definition you'll find herea method which is create elementso every widget that is there willcreate an element for itself statelesswidget will go ahead and createstateless elementstateful widget will go ahead and createstateful element so every widget willcreate an element for itself and thisElementary is does a reflection of thewidget tree so here if you have astateless widget you're going to have astateless elementnow if I created my app over here I'vebasically created my app elementI'm going to prove it to you by the timethis section ofhow flutter displaced UI Ends by the endof thischapter I'll be able to explain why I'msaying my app element is going to becreatedbut for now take my word on itevery widget will create an elementwhich will be a reflection of itselfright and they're only created when youfirst start the app during the mountphase so when you restartyou know this is where elements arecreatedand now Elementary is going to take careof whether render object needs to createstuff or it needs to update stuff sowhenever you make changes to the widgettree flutter performs a process calledreconciliation or diffing to identifythe differences between the new and theold trees and this process is quite easybecause widgets are immutablesince magic widgets are immutable all ofits properties are final and since theproperties are finalit's easier to compare the old widgettree and the new widget treeand this reconciliation process is doneso that widget tree doesn't continuouslyjust keep on creating render objectwidgets if it does that it will be a lotof performance waste you knowso we need to boost the performance weneed to make performant apps for thatthe flutter framework needs to beperformed and this is how flutterframework is performed by performing aprocess of reconciliation or diffingso it identifies the differences betweenthe new and the old trees and whateverdifferences are there only those thingsget updated or rebuilt for example let'ssay my text changes when I have my288.77 Kelvin over here and I restartlet's say this thing over here getsupdatedand let's say this text changes overhere to89.0 Kelvin so the render object is notgoing to build every other widget it'sjust going to build the text or the richtext againthis way our entire UI is not beingrebuilt or let's say our entire UI isnot being repainted again and because ofthiswe are getting performant appsto give you proof of this I'm just goingto go to thestateless widget againhere I have stateless element rightI'm going to go in there we havecomponent element and that finallyextends the element so I have elementover hereand you'll see down in the element thatwe have a functioncalled as update child and here itchecks if new widget is null or and ifthe child is not null then it willdeactivate the child and then it checksif the child is not null then it willperform some some task so basically thisfunction update child function is thething that will perform thereconciliation phaseafter reconciliation flutter willperform the layout phase where eachrender object will calculate the sizeand position of the associated widgetsand then render object will painteverything on the screenso now I hope you understand why we needthe elementary elementary is anintermediary between the widget and therender object trees that allows flutterto achieve efficient updates withoutrecreating the entire UI it will justrecreate one particular UI element orone particularobject andand Elementary is the reason why we havefeatures like hot reloading where youcan modify the widget tree and seeinstant updates in the running app forexample if I you know changethis totheme data dot light save it instantupdate happens and everything is nowthemedata dot light and if I againchange it everything is instantly themedata.docthis Elementary allows it becausestuff to update is so lessthat you can instantly do it and you cando it in the running app now hotreloading is a big feature becauseyou don't have to restart your app whenyou restart your app the entire thingrebuilds and because of thatyou might lose some very much neededexisting data for example let's say youwere filling a login form and then youpress enter and some error occurs youfix that error and then when you restartall of your credentials are gone youremail password everything that you hadentered is gonenow you have to refill those again thisis this is why hot reloading is a muchneeded feature because it saves so muchtimeso to summarize the widget tree definesthe UI structure Elementary will managethe widget life cycle and mutable Stateand render object will handle the layoutand painting the elementary will act asa bridge between the widget tree and therender object by performing thereconciliation process which willoptimize the updates that need to bemadenow since we've understand what elementsare we need to understand what buildcontext is now if you come to the buildcontext source code you'll see abstractclass build contextit has a widget it has owner it hasmounted all of its propertiesbut if you also go to stateless widgetstateless element component element andfinally to element you'll see abstractclass elementextends something but it implementsbuild context so basically element isbuild context or build context is anelementand it makes sense right becausebuild context helps us to locate awidget in the widget tree and what isthe limitelement is acting as an intermediarybetween widget tree and Elementary andrender objectory and every widgetcreates an element for itself so itexactly knows the state of the widget soit also knows where in the widget treeor where in the elementary thatparticular widget isand build context also knows that sobuild context is actuallyan element both of them help us tolocate a particular widget in the widgettreethey will help us compare the state ofthe widget and see if it needs a rebateand that's why many of the properties onbuild context is similar to what anelement might havefor example if you print context Dotmounted this is a property of elementwidget that's a property of elementand if you type in element you won't seecreate element method on itbecause build context is an elementyou get all of these typesand these help us to find particularthingsin the elementary now to prove to youthat an element is created a way of whatI'm going to do also to prove that buildcontext is an element I'm going to printcontext dot runtime type so this willtell me the type of build context when Ipress command J You'll see the runtimetype of build context is statelesselement now if I take the same thing andgo toweather screen let's scroll down andpaste it over here we'll have a statefulelement so build context is indeed anelementand that's a very neat way to handlestuffbecause now they're giving you theelement to access stuff and if you haveanythoughts about what the build contextruntime type it will be the particularelement it is in so it can be statefulelement stateless elementso I hope you understood stuff what wehave covered here is the three treeswidget Tree Elementary and render objecttree render object is the thing thatlooks after everythingrelated to painting Elementary is amediary which will handle if the renderobject needs to be repaint stuff andwidget tree is what we mention over hereit's just a simple configurationit is a lightweight object with finalproperties and it is immutable becauseit's so easy and it's so cheap to createthem and to throw them awaybecause the element is a manager thatwill control everythingand element can also handle and controlthe widget's location in the treebecause even build context can do thatwe have we've already seen it it alsohandles the life cycle of the widgetupdating of the render objects andeverythingsoElementary is a big pillar in the floodof frameworkand we are given access to the elementin the form of build context so we haveunderstood what build context isprogrammatically and the three types oftrees so this is the shopping app we aregoing to build with flutter we havegoing to have four products displayedover herewith their title price and the image wealso have a custom font for every thingthen when we click on a particularproduct we get directed to a productdetails screen where we again see thetitle The Shoe image the price and thesizes to select from if we don't selecta size we get a pop-up From Below sayingthat we need to select a sizethen once we select the size we can addto cart and the product will be added toour card successfully then we can goback come to a cart and we'll see thatparticular shoe in a cardI can also add more products here let'ssay I add Jordans let's say I add 10I'll add to card come back and I seeJordan shoes over here now I can alsodelete a product from a cart let's say Iwant to delete this men's Nike shoesI'll click on delete I get thisconfirmation dialogI can either click no or I can click onyes and that will remove the productfrom the cartso this is the app we're going to buildand we're going to learn a ton abouttheming navigation and State Managementso let's dive right into it the firstthing that's required is a flutterproject so we are going to go to thedesktop where I'm going to create myflutter project and run the commandflutter create let's call it shopunderscore app underscore flutterokayI already have shop underscore appcreated in the desktop which is why I'venamed the shop app flutter then I'mgoing to go to the shop app flutter openit in vs codeand then obvious code open I'll closethis for now I'll go to lib main Dotand we have our normal file okay I'malso going to run it on the iOSsimulator so thatwe know that the project is working welland we can confirm it in the meantimeI'm going to set up my screen over hereso for our own reference I have taken ascreenshot of the simulator and put ithere side by side so that we can havethe app and the US side by side cool sowe need to make this screen like thisthing over hereso let's clone it so first of all we'llhave to remove the counter app but onething I want you to note is this colorscheme Line This is color scheme colorscheme Dot from seed seed Color colors.dPurple okay and also remember the screenbecause I'm going to reference thislater onwhen we add theming to our ownapplication now let's get done with itlet's remove it then I'm going to createthe stateless widget call it my app thenI'm going to return a material appwhere the title is going to be shoppingappand thewhom is going to bea different widget so I'll have tocreate a different widget I'll go to thelib folder create home underscore pagedot dot this is all the boilerplatestuff I hope you are understanding it soI'll have to import material.dot againthen we'll have a stateless widget whichwill be called home page and we want toreturn a scaffoldso that an empty screen appears that'sitI only want to see an empty screen as ofnow we'll take it step by stepso we have home page returned over herethat is niceand now if I come over here our counterapp is now replaced by a blank home pageso we have the boilerplate stuff readynow the next thing I want to do is juststart designing the app but when westart designing the app you'll realizethat this font is a bit differentand the font we generally use in AndroidiOS it's different from what is presentover here why let's just take an exampleof the weather app we createdyou see this weather appthe font aware is quite different fromthe font mentioned over here so what weneed to do isadd our own custom fonts to the appso there are two ways to do it first wayis to use a package called Googleunderscore fonts this is provided bymaterial.iowhich is the Google team themselves andwe have it working on all the platformsAndroid iOS Linux Mac OS web windowsso what this does is basically a packageto use fonts from fonts.google.com andfonts.google.com is like a registry ofall the fonts that you can use freely inyour appsyou see it has a ton offonts you can useand you can use whatever one you wantbut the one I'm interested in using islato so this is the style I'll be usingand this is a style which is used overhere as wellnow you can explore and find your ownfont but I'm going to go ahead withlaternow you can use this fontto easily add later to your appall you need to do is mention a textwidgetthen you have this text you'll mentionthe style then you'll use Google fontswhich is provided by this Google fontspackage that we'll add to our app dotlater so when you call this later methodon Google fontsyou'll be able to add the laterfontto your app and your app will startlooking different that's all that youneed to doso this package has its own pros andcons the pro over here is it can be usedin production to reduce the app sizebecause you don't have to install thefont to yourapp you don't have to install it on yoursystem either all you need to do is justuse this andGoogle fonts package will gofetch the font using HTTP at runtimeand you'll be able to see it in the appyou see even in the dependencies youhave the HTTP package that one thatwe've already usedright the con is that it uses HTTPfetchingHTTP fetching as we all know can take alittle bit of time and that delay can beseen when you use Google fonts in yourapp it is a visible difference but nottoo muchso it depends on you if you want to usethis package or not I'm not going to useitI'm going to follow the alternativemethod which is registering the font inpubspect.aml file so as we know we canregister theAssets in pubspect.aml file but we arenot going to register assets fonts isdifferent from this thing over herewhen we scroll down you'll see aparticular section is dedicated to thefonts tab we need to use thatso you can add custom fonts to your appjust using this part and you can addyour images or your video all of thatfrom herewe're going to get to assets as well butfor now let's focus on fonts so I'm justgoing to uncomment all of thisall of this and make sure indentation isright that means the spacing over hereis right becauseit matters in yaml filesthen here we have several things tomention first of all we have to mentionthe asset and its locationwell we don't have any assets but youcan go ahead and install it fromfonts.google.comyou can see your style whichever one youprefer you can select that style it willadd it and once you've selected all theStyles you want just click on downloadall and it will download it for you inyour systemI already have a few downloaded for meso I'll just open themI have later bold and later light whichis what I'm going to use if you want touse the same font style I'll mention thelink for it in the description belowso now to register it I'm not going toput these font files in lib folder lipfolder strictly for my DOT code it isn'tgoing to have any assets or anythingmy assets is going to be present in aseparate folder of its own in the rootfolder so I'm going to create my ownfolder called assetsfontshere I'm creating two folders because Idon't want to mention ad sets just likethis in the root folder it's quite messybut I'll create my assets folder thenthe fonts folder becauseI'm going to have two types of assetsimages and fontsthe dummy data that there is this imagethis is coming from our assets itselfwhich are registered in pubspect.aml sowe have to register images as wellthat's why I've created the fonts foldernow I can just copy themalso we can open fonts and finderand paste it over here as soon as wepaste it in the correct folder you willbe able to see later bold and laterlightcorrectlysweet now we'll just have assets slashfonts later light Dot ttf and then weare going to have assets fonts laterbold.ttf you need to make sure that thispath matches you are in the root folderso you'll go to assets this folder thenfonts and then you'll Target oneparticular file and make sure you dothat correctlyttf it should match word by word letterby letteralso the style here is not going to beitalic it is going to be 700 with aweight you can mention the style it canbe italic or anything else but I want towant to mention the weight aware becausethis little bold font should only getactivated when my weight is 700 andweight 700 means it is bolded and alsoyou need to mention your custom fontfamily name aware so you can go aheadand pass in later later whatever youwant to call it I'm going to call thislater and make sure control s is pressedso flood up object is run and then yourcontents of the app is there with youperfectnow we'll go to home page and just tosee if the fonts are loaded properly ornot you can go to body text itand let's say you type in hello worldsave it and we have hello world overbut it's in the corner so we are goingto center it so I'll press Ctrl shift Rthe refactoring options and I'm going towrap it with the center widgetAlso let's put comma for formatting andwhen we come away hello world is seeingbut there is no difference inthe font why because if you again go topubspect.aml file you'll see that therearefonts family and there aremultiple types of fonts you can describeover here you can have more than onefont family described over hereso if there are multiple font Familieshow will flutter knowwhich font family to use and that is whyit asked you for the family name overherethe family name for this fontso to make sure you're using the rightfont family you need to mention it inthe text so you're going to have Styletextile and textile has a property offont family and it accepts a string soyou need to mention the font family youmentioned in thepubspect.aml file which is later overherethen save it restart your app and you'llsee a different font is used nowif it still doesn't work for you thenagain you have to check font family ifit's the correct thing if the asset iscorrectly mentioned check your terminaldebug console if there is any erroror you might want to terminate the appand restart it again and you'll be ableto see the differenceso anyways I have font family now if Ihavefont weight as font weight dot bold Ishould be seeing the bolded textileright and we certainly donow you might say hey why have wementioned two font assets over herewhy have you mentioned light and boldboth of themyou can't remove bold right if you justmentioned later you'll be able to use acustom font and when you use Font weightdot bold it will bold it like this foryouwell let's try it I'm going to removelater boldrestart the app and you see a visibledifferencethe textile and all of that is the samebut stillthe style over here for this fontchangedthat's because fontlater boiled is different from laterlight which is bolded in this case whatwas happening was later light was boldedso it was less bold however here we areusing later bold which has a distinctiveproperty of its ownand thus we are using two fonts for onefont family and since we've mentionedweight 700 it is able to identify whento use that kind of fontokaysweetnow let's go ahead and design the appwhen we see a wire we have multiple textwe have text over here used we have textover here even here and it's scatteredall over the app does that mean I'llhave to use this style textile fontfamily later every time I need touser text and use a custom textileor a custom font familyno that can be quite cumbersome justimagine you have to do it over your yourevery single place and if your app getsbigger and bigger it will be verydifficult to manage it that's whyfont family is generally not used for aparticular text you can Define itoverall in your my app in the materialapp by using the theme propertyso team will set up the overalltypography in your app and that willwork fine so you mentioned theme dataand it has a property of font familywhich you can use it requires a stringso mention later whereand now without doing anything withoutmentioning any textile it still useslaterit's not bolded because I removed thetextile font weight dot bowl however ifyou bold it it will still work finecool so now we have set the overalltypography in the app now let's go aheadand set up the overall coloring in ourappnow remember in the counter app I toldyouto remember one line which was the colorscheme line well that's what we want tomentionwhat I want to do is set up the overallcolor for my app and I only have onemain color decided which is this yellowcolor what I want is the rest of mycolors the rest of the thingsused in my app should be derivative ofthatso I want to mention just one color andbased on that one color the entire colorscheme is going to be generatedso we can use that so let's go ahead andpass in a color scheme and as soon as wedo that there are multiple arguments weneed to pass in and they are quite a lotyou need to pass brightness primary onprimary secondary on secondary error onerror background on background surfaceon Surfaceif you don't mention that you'll faceerrorsso definitely this is quite a cumbersometask and many people wouldn't want thatthey want to develop a symbol appwhere the key focus isbuilding functional app not generatingan entire UI so for that we have dotdark which will help you generate a darkthemethen you have color scheme dot lightwhich will help you to generate lighttheme but you also have color scheme Dotfrom seedso with this you just have to mentionone thing the seed color based on theseed color the entire coloring of yourapp will be set upand it will work fine for you now thinkof terms ofa treefor a tree to grow you need to pass in aseed right this is what it requires youpass in a seed and the tree growsaccordingly if you pass in a watermelonseed of watermelon thing will be grownif you have a pomegranate pomegranatewill be grown and so onsame way we need to mention a seed colorwhich will be the base from which allother colors will be derived all colorswill be based onso Mike Seed color is going to be theyellow color which I've mentioned overhere andI know the RGB o for it so we are fromRGB o and then I'll mention 254206 1 1. so this is the RGB for itand opacity is full all right now wehave it over here no visible differencesbut we've set the overall theme of ourapp fromfrom seed method we are able to generatethe primary secondary surface colorsyou'll see over here using the seedcolor as a starting point a set of tonalpalettes are constructed these tonalpalettes are based on the material threecolor system and provide all the neededcolors for a color schemethese colors are designed to work welltogether and meet contrast requirementsfor accessibilityand if you want to know more about ityou can click over here open it and readabout it in the material 3 designdocumentationokayso now that we have set this up and Ithink everything is ready let's go tothe home page and design our app so thefirst thing is we need a header now thisheader is a bit different all the adderswe have seen in the past requiresomething like this it should be thislong and it should be present over hereshoes collection and then you have asearch boxnow this is quite big for an app bar soit's definitely not an app bar that weare going to use we have to customcreate it whenever you have a headersort of thing it doesn't necessarilymean you have to use an ABBA it will befine if you don't use an ABBAbut it should match whatever design youhave in mind and make it pixel to pixelso let's go ahead here in the bodyI'm going to pass in a column and in thecolumn I'm going to mention children andmy first childis going to be a text which will sayshoes collection so shoes will be on oneline and collection on anotherso let's go ahead and have text shoescollectionsave itlet's put com up properly so that wehave the right formattingand we have our shoes collection showingup at the topnow what I want to do is put shoecollections bigger bolded and it shouldbe right below the notch just like wehave it over hereThe Notches over here so it's this fontis mentioned over hereso I want it below the notch first ofall we are going to go ahead and improvethe style so we have textilethen we have font weight as fontway dotbold and font size is let's say35 let's save it and we are going tohave shoes collection over here nice nowthe problem is it's quite at the top Idon't want it at the top I wanteverything starting below the notch sofor this we have a nice widget that wehaven't used till now and that is thesafe area widget so we are going to wrapit so we are going to have Ctrl shift Rthe defactoring options and we're goingto wrap it with a widget which is knownas safe areawhat safe area widget does is it ignoresthetopnotchit avoids the bottom Notch as well orthe bottombar over here you can see this line itavoids that as wellso safe area as the name suggests is asafe area where notches are not thereand even these bottom things are nottherenow if you see if this shoes collectionautomatically comes down and it looksgoodthe next thing I want to do is putcollection right below so I'm going tohave shoesslash n collectionI've put backslash n because as we knowbackslash n is used to go to a new linewe have seen this in the dot post we'llsave it and we have shoes collectionover here perfectthe next thing I want is in the sameline as shoes collection I want to put asearch field so for this we know whatwidget to use text field but what wewant is both of them to be in the sameline if I mention it below this let'ssay I call text field over here andlet's say I do this I have my text fieldover here perfect right but the problemhere is this is present right below it Iwant it side by sideso to make it side by side I'll have towrap text and text field in oneparticular widget which is a rowso we are going to have row children andthen we are going to have text and textfieldput it inside save itand now we have it but the text fieldisn't showing up why is that the casewell that's the case because if youpress command Jand let's say you restart your app youhave a bunch of Errors showing upandif you want you can go ahead and readthis error to understand what really ishappening but if you don't understand itdon't worry basically I've told it toyou before that text field occupiesmaximum width it can getit takes in as much widthas a device hasso here in a row it is not gettingas much width as the device has becausethe text is present over here so it'soverlapping and thinking hey why am Inot gettingthe maximum width or you can say thedevice widththat's why we need to constrain the textfieldso that it only takes as much space asit's told it doesn't go ahead and takethe entire device with that's notallowedagain if you didn't understand just toexplain it to youthe text field has a tendency of takingas much width as possible on the devicethat is why when we had mentioned textfield in a column belowit took the entire device with but herewhen we put it inside of a row itdoesn't get the entire device width itonly gets this much width which is notacceptable by itbecause this text is taking some spaceso we need to tell it that hey you needto be fine with this much space you'regettingso for that we'll have to wrap textfield with a widget and that is thesized box widget here we are going tomention the width let's say50 maybe that is enoughand then we can save it so we have textfield showing up which is quite small 50is quite a small width so maybe we want250and this is still not enough maybe 270and you see we get an error a renderflow erroroverflowed by one pixelso maybe we want 269 but I'm going to goahead with 260.so here's the problem now if I mention260 hereit will be different on a pixel emulatorso let's get a pixel emulator up andrunning and see how it looks on thepixel emulator as welland then we'll be able to decide if itworks fine on all device sizes or notif it works fine on all device sizesthen we are good with 260 otherwise theyneed to be made some changes so pixelemulator is now up and running and asyou can see we are getting a render flowerror on the pixel screenso that goes to say that the pixel sizethat we have mentioned over here doesn'twork for this case so let's just removethe size box and think of some othersolution whatever width we mention isnot going to be the same for bothAndroid and iOS or for different screensizes in generalso let's just generalize this problemwhat do we want we want this text fieldto take as much space as possible afterthis shoes collection has taken itspeaceso what we can do first of all is takethis text put it in a padding widget sothere's padding all around it and afterthatwe can tell search or text field to takeas much space space as availableso what I'm going to do is press Ctrlshift R get the refactoring options wrapit with padding so we have constantagencies.all but it is not enough I wantit to shift quite a bit so maybe I canshift it to 20 and this looks betterafter that in the text field I'm goingto use another widgetwhich is called as expandedwhat expanded does and it is generallyused in either a row or a column isit just tells hey take as much space asmuch width as possible it doesn't sayhey take the entire device with it saysjust take as much space and width aspossible in this row or in this columnwherever you're defining it and now onboth this devices it takes the samespace there's the padding of the textwidgetand after that it has its own text fieldright so it works on all screen sizesso that's the cool thing about usingexpanded you don't have to use pixels oryou don't have to mention any heightwidth Etc you can just use expand it totell hey just take as much space asavailable in a row or a columncool now that we have this let's goahead and Define or Design This searchfield and I'm going to keep the pixelemulator on the side as long as it's notbothering menow let's go ahead and create the searchso what do we want well first of all Iwant this text to appear and it shouldjust be a hint a label wouldn't lookgood right if you have search writtenover here and when you click on it thesearch will go on the top we won't wedon't want that kind of labelwe do want hint text so we'll go to thetext field we already know we'll pass ina decoration input decoration and thehint text is going to be what searchand if we do that much and let's comeover here save it we have search writtenover here that's nicenow I want to bold this text because thetext is not bold and maybe I want toreduce its height as wellso for that I can do it over here in theinput decoration itself but the problemhere iswhenever I want to create a text field Iwant this kind of design I don't wantanything else I want this text to beboldedI want mystuff as it is for every single textfield I create so that's why what I'mgoing to do is go to the main dot dotand in the theme I'm going to define theinput decoration so every time I createa text field or I use input decoration Iwant a similar kind of theme so I'mgoing to have input decoration theme andthis doesn't ask for just inputdecoration it asks for input decorationtheme so let's go ahead and pass it inand let's mention the thing that we wantan input decoration theme I want thehint style to be given a proper style sowe are going to have textileand here the font weight first of all isgoing to be there so we are going tohave font weight dot bold and then weare going to have font size which is 16.so this is now bolded and looks betterin my opinionlet's put it over here also let's put aconst here and for the home page as wellpeel product cons that's nicethe next thing we want is an iconso obviously we know what to use prefixicon because we want it in the front ifyou've ordinated it in the back we woulduse suffix icon but let's go ahead withprefix icon and here we can mention ouricon we already know how to use theicons class so we have icon icons Dotsearchand just to clarify icons dot searchis icon data and this is a widget youcannot just use icons dot search awarebecause icons doesn't extend the widgetclassso we need to wrap it with icon whichtakes in an icon data and icons isan icon data all rightlet's save it come away and we have thisnow what I want isthe color to be samesoagain for all mytext Fields I want the icon color toremain the same so I'll come in theinput decoration theme and have prefixicon color color dot from rgboand here I'm going to mention a colorwhich we have found out one one nine oneone nine one one nine oneso this color is kind of grayishand you won't see big differences but itthere is a differenceso for every text field I create this isgoing to be the theme data I canobviously override itfor example if I just override the colorover here let's go ahead and type in acolors.redthe color is now red so you can overrideit but if you don't pass anything itwill take the default theme from hereand this will only match particularthings for example input decoration hinttext style can be passed over here andit will follow that if you pass in alabel style only label will follow thisparticular property not hen Styleso if you pass anything over here forexample a color or anything it willfollow that and if you don't passanything the default will be what youmentioned in the theme in the theme datanow the next thing is to put bordersover here and to put a border it can bea bit differentfor every text field we create forexample in the home screen I want Idon't want a text field like thisbecause here the text field is like thisit goes straight then there's a curve onthe left and then it again goes straightso I don't want this kind oftext field border for every text fieldwe createthat's why I'm not going to mention itin the theme data I'm going to mentionit right over hereso yeah I'm gonna go ahead and addborderin the decoration I need to add sorryborder and that will include borderlike this but this is an abstract classyou already know so we can use outlineinput borderor you can use an underline border Iwant an outline input border because Iwant a clear background or clear borderlike thisthen I'm going to have Border Side whereBorder Side is Border Side like thisthe color will be there and color willbe color dot from rgbo 225225 225 and one this is another color Ifound out from the figma designso we can paste it over and don't worryabout the warnings as of now if we justput one constant over here the errorsare gone butwe can't be sure about it yet becausetext field requires a controller andcontroller cannot be a constant so I'mnot putting it as of nowso there we go we have our Border Sideready as wellnow if we come over here we are able tosee stuffnow what I want is the Border radius tobe present so let's go ahead and passthe Border radiusso we are going to have bought a radiusborder radius Dothorizontalyou can also use water radius dotcircular but that will be for everywhereI only want it from the left that's whyI'm going to use border radius Dothorizontal of course you can also useonly but then you'll have to set topleftand bottom left both because you want acurve from your and a curve from herebut I know I want it from the horizontaltotally so I can just mention left hereand let's say I pass in a radius dotcircular of 50. cool now we can save itwe come over here and we have our borderradius looking good only from the lefthand side not from the right hand sideif we add right as welllet's try it out we have somethinglooking like this and this might be goodfor other text fields that we create notfor this so we are going to have asimple left like this nice this looksnice now the problem is the color isn'texactly what I mentionedso I've mentioned the Border over herebut this color is quite different fromwhat is over here it is taking thedefault color so what I'm going to do ispush this border outand I'm going to have final border whichis equal to border just like we did inthecurrency converter app as well rememberand we're going to put a constant herebecause this is a constantthen we can pass border over here thenwe can have enabled borderpass the Border same way and now you seethe design changes enable border is thisborder and focus border is the borderthat we see right nowso focused border has a predefined colorand it has a predefined color because ofthisseed colorwhen we passed in color scheme Dot fromseed it generated a design theme of itsown using whichit is giving us this color it thinksthis is a nice color with seed color asyellowso let's just remove it and see you seeas soon as I remove seed color it's nowblue the default themethat's why I've mentioned seed coloraware so that it can generate on its ownbut I still don't likethis border color over hereso what I can do is pass in focusedborder and pass the border to it as wellso when it's in focuswe get the same overall theme let'srestart andthat restarts it only for iOS not forAndroidso let's go ahead and restart it forAndroid as wellnow we have restarted and everythinglooks greatso this is nicewe are creating uis that will fiteverywhere that's nice the next thing Ineed is is this chipor you can say these filterssothere are two options we can take herefirst one is creating a list of filtersthen using list view Builder that wehave already seen on the weather screenand displaying it over here that soundsnice right so let's do it we'll go toour codeand for now let's just wrap everythingin a const afterwe start building stuff the text fieldmight need a controller so we can put itthenso what I'm going to do isDefine a list so I'm going to have finallist of string filters of companies andthen I'm going to have a list but assoon as I create this I can't Define aconstant Constructor because the fieldfilters is initialized as a non-constantvalue so I can put Constable here andthat fixes everything because list likethis is a constant but I have what Iwant is the company names to be presentin the filters so first of all I'llmention it I'll have all then I can haveadded us then I can have Nike and then Ican have bought outcool now have all of those filters now Ican use a list view Builder to displaythem on the screenso let's havea list view Builder this will take in acontext and an indexthen we can have an item count and asyou can see as soon as we put a listview Builder we get errors all over theplace and that's because listviewBuilder is not a constant so let's goahead remove it and add a constant forevery single widgetthat looks nicenow in item count what is our item countwell whatever or how many filters arepresent over heremy filters here are filters dot lengthand this crosses my mind that yeah youcould use a row here to display thesewidgets but again if you have morecategories or more filters in the futurefor your application not just fourthings maybe you have a fifth brand Pumaor something as well you want to add ityou can do that by just mentioning thevalue over here and everything else willtake care of itselfyou only have to update the value overhere you don't have to go like heysince I added one value I'll have to addone more widget no filters.length willtake care of itbecause you are specifying the value aslet's say this is 4 so it will buildfour times if you add a Fifth Element itwill build five times and it will buildaccording to the data we pass and thedata I want to pass in over here isthese name of the companies onlyso let's go ahead now how do I createthis kind of UI right this looks quiteinterestingso to create this kind of UI there is awidget you can obviously go ahead anduse the container to create this kind oflayoutand that's totally possible but fluttermakes our life easier by providing uswidget for itand that is the chip widget when youreturn a chip you just have to provideone label andit will create a chip out of it chip isthis thing onlyof course you can create a container andmake it do your work but there's awidget for it and there are so manywidgets that I won't be able to coverall of them in this course so you needto constantly look up for yourselfif you have a doubt you can ask it onGoogleor on our Discord server and you'll begetting help for itbut if there is no specific widget forit you can create your own combinationof widget and get it workinganyways coming back to the label what isour label well it's these texts only soI want filters at index whatever we arebuilding forso we are going to have final filter isequal to filters at index then I'm goingto have the label which requires awidget so I'm going to pass in a textwhich will be a filter save it we comeover hereand we see nothing why let's open thedebug console and we again have an errorand this error is quite similar to whatwe had before when we laid out a textfeedthe problem is the same list viewBuilder wants to take the entire heightof the screen and you're not giving itthat now if Iremove this thing also I think I've madea mistake hereI should not be passing in a rowI should be passing it out of the columnnow this is a mistake you need tounderstand thisI had passed in a rowokay so it consisted of these two thingsit consisted of these two things in arow now what I want is an element overhere so I need to pass it in a columnwhich I have already created right Ihave a column over hereso I need to mention my chip or my listview Builder out of this widget of rowokayso I can come down over hereI've put the list view Builder but theproblem Still Remains the Same it wantsthe entire height of the screen and it'snot getting the entire height of thescreenso now we want to restrict the height sofor this we have already seen we can usesize box now if I use expanded over hereand save it yeah I do see stuff butwhat's happening is it's taking theentire width of the screen I don't wantit to take the entire height of thescreen in any case I only wanted to takeas much height as I tell it to takeso what I'm going to do is wrap it witha sized box instead and then I'm goingto mention a height of let's say 120then save it and I have this now you seeI have a scrollable list of filtersnow I'm going to go here and pass in ascroll Direction which will be accessdot horizontal so everything ishorizontal now but we need a paddinglike a margin sort of thing that we havehere between every chip so let's addthat we're going to wrap chip with apadding widgetand if I do constant Edge and such dotall it will be from all the sites I onlywant it from the horizontal side I don'twant it from the vertical side rightso I'm going to have dot symmetric I canuse dot only left 8 and write it butdoes the same as doing Dot symmetrichorizontal 8. I hope you're getting itwe've already discussed about this butI'm still clarifying in case you didn'tunderstand it then and here we have ourwidgets showing up perfect now I onlywant to increase theirheightnow to increase their height what shouldI dodoes Chip have a height property let'sseeit doesn't have anything height or sizerelatedso what I need to use is a paddingto increase the height of thechip I'm just going to increase thepadding around it so it increases thepaddingand this will become biggerso to I've already passed in a paddingover here right and it looked at theoutside it didn't look at the inside ofthe chip widgetand that's why chip also has a paddingproperty of its ownyou can pass that in so you have paddingEdge and sets Dotthen you can pass in all or symmetricwhatever you want if I pass an agentsearch dot all 15.this looks good not bad but the problemI have with it isit's not looking as good as I want it tolook so what I'm going to do is I'mgoing to increase its padding from thehorizontal side and make it differentfor the vertical side so that will giveme a better feel of itso what I'm going to do is Edge in suchdot symmetric then I'm going to havehorizontal as 20 and vertical as 15.save it also put Constable here andthere we gothis looks much better and is as similaras this rightbut yeah the text is quite small solet's make the label style bigger wehave label here so we can either pass ina style over here or a label style forit so we have label style and then wecan have textilefont size 16.then also put a const around it save itand become aware and this looks betterit is scrollable over here it might beextendingthis part and that is why we are notgetting an error if we wrapped it with arow we would get an error and then wewould have to wrap it with a singlechild scroll view what we've seen in theweather app beforebut anyways coming back to this thislooks nicethe last problem or the second lastproblem is the color so let's change thecolor and for every chip that I createI want a particular color to be presentso I can change the chip color from hereI'll pass in the background color andthe background color can beconstant color dot from rgbo and thenyou mentioned the rgbo which will be 245247249 and 1. then we save it you come overhere and we see the similar coloring nowobviously this looks a bit differentfrom this one but if you take ascreenshot save it away and get it sideby sideboth of them will look similar just tomake this look more prominent what I'mgoing to do is add a border as well soyour chip also allows us to pass insomething known as a side and we alreadyknow what Border Side does it will helpus to create a border of a particularcolor so I can pass in a border sidewhich will have a color of the samething as this one so I'm going to haveconstant color as this also let's put aconstiersave it become aware and this does lookmore prominent okayand the last thing I want to do here ismake the Border radius more curvedso I want this to be more curved justlike this one so I can decrease theBorder radiusso for that we also have anotherproperty which is the shape that willallow us to do that so we have roundedrectangular border where you can mentionborder radius and that will be borderradius dot circular30. it's all tried and tested values allright when I was building the app forthe first time I tried values like 10 1520 30 and whichever one I liked I keptit and I like 30 so here it is and thislooksexactly like this one all rightnow the next thing I want to do is theselection of this chip so whenever Iselect a particular chipI want that particular chip to have ayellowish color so for this my plan isvery simpleI obviously need to know what filter isselected so that I can filteraccordingly so I need to know that yeahall is selected so I want to show allthe products I want to know added alsoselected so that I can filter all theAdidas products and so on so Idefinitely need to know that what filterwas selected so I need to store the nameof this filter so I'll be using a stringto store my stateafter that you know whatever is clickedon I can just use gesture detector toknow which one was tap and then save itin my stateso for that I'll have to convert thisfrom a stateless to a stateful widgetlet's do thatthen I'm going to create anothervariable which is string selected filterand that will be equal to filters atzero but when I try to do this it saysthe instance member filters can't beaccessed in an initializerit basically means that hey you'vecreated the list of filters over hereand now you're saying you want to usefilters at zero you can't use aninitialized value again in to initializesomething elseso what you can do instead is use latestring selected filter and then use NHState because this is the first thingthat calls before the build functionand then we can set selected filterequal to filters at zero and that willwork fineokay all rightnow what I'm going to do is takeselected filter and whenever I tap onthe chip so let's see if tab has ChipHazard on top propertyand it doesn'tso we'll have to wrap the chip with agesture detector widget now here's thequestion should I wrap the gesturedetector property with chipor should I wrap padding with gesturedetectormeaning gesture detector should be usedlike this like wrap with Widget gesturedetector should be used like thislet's see if I use on tap and let's sayI just print hiif I do this press command Jlet's restart the entire appand we'll do the same for iPhone as wellwe'll come away and let's say we selectadded us High gets printed that'scorrect but if I printoutside of added off let's say over hereit still prints why because you'vewrapped it around a padding widget whatpadding does is it's saying thatthis particular thing this part is Onewidget this part is One widgetit is not just including this particularwidget it is also including stuff on thesidebecause that's what padding does paddingcreatesa spacingan empty spacing from the left and theright hand sideso that's what padding is doing and inclosing it with a gesture detectoryou're saying that whenever I click overhereI want a particular filter to beselected and that's not how my app isgoing to work my app is going to workonly when the chip is clicked on so I'mgoing to remove the gesture detectorfrom your I'll press command Zthen I'll wrap the chip widget with agesture detectorand then I'm going to have on tapprint let's say hithen I come over here I click on addedas it prints but when I click outside ofadded auth it is not printing coolso it was a very minorthing but it definitely helps to improvethe logicyo so coming back to what I wanted to doselected filter should be equal to thefilter we have over here right so youhave selected filter which is equal tofilter save itandyeah we've just made short selectedfilter is changed now I want thebackground color to change according towhat the selected filter isso if selected filter is equal to filterso if selected filter what we haveselected is equal to the filter that weare on so if added off is there and it'sclicked on the selected filter and thefilter is the same thing so I want theyellow color to be there so if selectedfilter is equal to filter then I wantthe yellow colorand whenever you find yourself repeatingmany colors what you can do is set upthe theme for it now I want to accessthe seed color so what I can do is themedot of contextDot color scheme dot seed color butthere's nothing like seed color given bycolor scheme then what should I usethat's the point of seed color schemeDot from seed is basically like heygive me a seed and I'll build everythingbased on itthere's no seed color in color schemeclassin this class of color scheme there'snothing likeseed color so we cannot use it what canwe use well we can try to use primaryright and when we come aware the primaryis quite different from what I wanted myprimary to bemy primary was supposed to be yellowbut it's not yellowbecause we have built from seed so whenwe have built from seed adjusters it haspredefined some colors that will lookgood and it thinks this is a good colorfor a chip and I disagree I wantedsomething else so what I can do here isoverride the existing colorso I'll just say the primary colorshould also be this and when I do thisand let's say I restart my app you seeyellow color is there and it looks goodI'll restart it on Pixel emulator aswelland you see it looks niceso again to explain what happened overherewe generated from seed seed color isjust there so that it can build stufffor youit can build colors for you andautomatically assign them so itcreated the primary color also for youbut I didn't like the primary colorgenerated so what I did was replaced itwith my own primary colorand here is my primary color rest of thethings like secondary color orsurface color all of that can be definedby this color scheme only I only wantthe primary color here to change andthen to access it what I've done istheme.off context dot color scheme dotprimary to understand how this worksbehind the scenes I'm going todemonstrate or create a diagram for youand once we understand theme dot offcontext.color scheme.primary like how isthis actually fetching this primarycolor we'll understand the basics ofState Management the basic principles ofState Management in flutter so this ishow it works let's say you have a rootwidget and the root of your widget isthis all right and here I'm going tohave root written so this is the root ofour widget and let's put the root widgetyeah this looks goodand the root widget is followed by ourwidget tree so we have one widget overhere and let's say there are multipleother widgets and then every widget hasits own sub widgets as well like columnit has multiple children so you can havethose as welllet's say this is our entire widget treea very simple demonstration all rightand let's say this is our material appso after root we directly have ourmaterial appin the material app we have set up thetheme and all of that stuff so we haveall the stuff related totheming all rightnow material lab behind the scenesconfigures all of the theme relatedstuff and sets it up globally for yourentire app so it does that behind thescenes so it has all the theme relateddata over here so let's call this themedata now in some descending widget let'ssay in this widgetwhat I've done is called ourtheme dot off context right this is themain part theme dot off contextby calling theme dot off context you'retriggering something known as inheritedwidget so if we just come over here tothe home page go to themewe see a stateless widget but when we goto theme dot off contextwe have inherited theme and if we go toinherited theme it extends a narratedtheme and inherited theme extendsinherited widgetso we are using something known as thenarrated widget which we've talked abouta lotwhenever we talked about widgets sothere are three types of widgetsstateless stateful and inheritedbut we never got the opportunity to saythatwhere do we use an edited wizard this iswhere you use a narrated widgetinherited widget is used for StateManagement by the flutter frameworkwhenever it wants to talk to the parentwidget as of now we've seen thatwhenever we want some data to be passedto the child how we do that is byConstructor so if material wants to givesomething to our home page it will passit through the Constructor if home pagewants to give something to some otherwidget it will pass it through theConstructor again if it wants to passsomething to the Constructor it can dothat but how will we do it in reversefor that State Management is there andanother problem here is what if mymaterial app doesn't want to keeppassing everything to the build functionor through the Constructor right everytime it has to go through theConstructor that is quite cumbersomewhen you have a large widget setright now we only have four so itdoesn't matterfor you but later on when we have biggerwidget tree you'll say hey this is sucha bigger budget tree do I have to passit through the Constructor every singletime and this is where inherited widgetwill help you inherited widget will justsay hey you want me to pass some datadown to the widget tree you can pass itto any widget like thisso it will just skip it it will skip allthe Constructor part and it willdirectly havethe data given to it so this is whattheme dot off context does it will justtell the parentwidget whenever it sees the theme widgetit is just going to go there and grabthe data from it to repeat what I saidhow theme dot off context works is itgoes up the widget tree and startsfinding the nearest theme widget as soonas it finds a nearest theme widgetit will grab the properties of it anduse whatever is necessary so if teamdata was mentioned over herelet's say theme data was also presentover here and team data was also presentover here both the places so theme dotoff context is directly going to go tothis theme data it won't go to thistheme data it won't go because it willfind the nearest theme data widget foritthat is how team.off context works sobasically what team dot off context doesis find its nearest widget its nearestancestor widget of the same type sincethis is team it will also find themelater on we'll see stuff life now likeNavigator dot off contexteven then what it does isfind the nearest Navigator widgetand use that to display its routes oryou know do its navigation stuff butwe'll get to it but this is how team.offcontext works and this is how inheritedwidgets workwe are not going to write code ininherited widget if you want to do thatI'll mention a resource below which iscreated by the flutter team themselvesand that will provide you with a cleardescription however what I'm going to dois just explain how theme data worksso if you've understood you can skip itand if you've not understood I'm goingto explain it again how this works iswhenever you call theme dot off contextthis off context goes ahead and FindsIts nearest ancestor widgetso it will go and search for any themewidget that is nearest to it and once itfinds it we get theme data it will usethe properties mentioned over theresuppose if theme data is not mentionedover hereit will go to the root widget to findthe theme dataand even if it's not mentioned in thetheme data root it will still have itbecause material lab behind the scenesdoes create a theme data if you want tomention itand change it you can change it but ifyou don't mention and change itthen it will use the default theme theblue color theme or the pink color themeit has already created all right so Ihope you understood this explanationthis is what it does this is inheritedwidget and this is how State managementin general works with flutterwe are going to take a look at a similarthing in Navigator as well I'm going toexplain it thenso if you didn't understand it now anopportunity will be later on however Iwould still recommend you to understandit right now so coming back to this wehave selected filter is equal to filterand when we have this it will have acolor scheme dot primary so it goes andfinds its nearest theme data widget itfound it and then it will access itscolor scheme primary widget perfectnow if I try to change it it doesn'tchange why well that's because theselected filter is equal to filter butyou've not called set statewhen we have not called such Statehowever therewidget rebuild that's why we need towrap it with a such state so that thebuild function rebuilds and then we canproperly select a particular widgetperfect now that we have this done aswelllet's just get rid of the warnings byprotecting a const over herenow the next thing after the list viewBuilder and the size box in the columnis displaying these cardsour data so let's save it let's closeall the save files I'm going to go inthe lib folder and create a new variableor a new file called Globalvariables.dot and this contains myGlobal variables and fileand my Global variableis the dummy data that I want so mydummy data is going to be a list of mapsstring comma Dynamic so it is going tocontain a list of products and myproducts are going to be mentioned inthe form of a mapso we are going to have a final list ofmap string comma Dynamic why dynamicbecause we also have a price to mentionlet me give you an example let's have afinal productswhich is equal to a list and this listis going to have a mapfirst of all there's going to be a titleof the product so let's say the title ismenand then I want apostrophe s but if I dothat it will give me an error so I'llput a backslashso it will ignorethissingle inverted commaand act as if this is a normal singleinverted comma all right then yeah men'sNike shoes we save itnow you won't be able to see anything onthe screenobviously we have not displayed anythingthe next thing we need is a price sowe'll go ahead and set the price let'ssay 44.52now all to all the shoes enthusiasts ifthe value is incorrect forgive me for itthen you are going to have sizes this isa list of sizes from which the user canselect and this is shown on the productdetails screen so we have 8 comma 5 and9 comma 10 comma 11. so I hope you areunderstanding why this is a list of mapstring comma object or dynamic then Iwant the image URL and this image URLright now is going to be an asset lateron it's going to be coming from the webitself because when the user uploads theimage from the device it is going to bestored in the database and then we aregoing to get the URL from the databaseto display it on the web now if youdon't understand it don't worry don'tworry at all justknow that this image URL is theURL we are going to have in the assetsso let's go ahead and create an imagestab and import all the images now youcan find anything from webwhich is a shoe and you can paste it foryourself but I already have it with meif you want the same images as me youcan find it in the description againbelowAlso let's open this images andfinder let's paste itcome over here we have all the imagesyou can view it in vs code itself that'snicenow I can go to the pubspect.aml filescroll up we have assets imagesI can just uncomment everything andmention the path to my images just likewe did for font so I'm going to haveassets slash Images slash shoesunderscore one dot PNG and you need todo that for all themshoes one two three four so let's goahead and type it outnow yeah it depends on you if you wantto do it for all the images you can doit one by one or you can just excludeeverything and just have assets slashimagesslash you need to put this slash here ifyou don't put a slashand you put it like this it will thinkimages is some sort of fileand if you put a slash away it willthink Images slash is a folder so weneed to import everything in this folderso if you do this it will import all theimages to your obspect.yaml in yourflutterprojectnow you can use anythinginside of your app now a disadvantage ofdoing Images slashis suppose you add some other imagewhich is not related to your app butjust to test it out let's say I addshoes underscore file and I never use itin my appbut I've still registered itthat will add unnecessary weight orunnecessarysize to my application and we want toreduce it as much as possible so yeahalways try to reduce the applicationsizegreat now we can close this and we canmention the image URL we have assetsslash Images slash shoesunderscore one dot PNGnow you can copy paste this again andagain so that you have appropriate stuffso I'm going to paste it four times nowif you don't want to write all of thisby yourselfwhat you can do insteadis check the description of the videothere you'll find a link and you cancopy all of the product data from therewhich is what I'm going to doso I can select everything paste it overhere and I have products I did miss onething which was or two things ID andCompanyso what company is this or what brand isthis shoe offthis will help us to figure out how tofilter things and then an ID for everyproductand then we have the correct image URLfor everythingwe also have another thing over herewhich is the cart I hope you copied thatas well and that is a dummy data for thestuff to be shown in the cart later onwhen we add State Management it is goingto be dynamic but just when we arecreating the UI we want it simple rightso we will just have our card as a dummydata perfect now let's close this go tothe home pageand just before the column ends becauseI still want it in a column right wehave our first element of the column arow then the second element has a listview Builder and the third elementwell what is this going to bethis is going to be a list view Builderas well rightthis is going to be a list view BuilderbecauseI want to build all the productsthat I can see products.link and I wantto display a product card for it everysingle time I have thatso we are going to use a list viewBuilder as well so I'll type out listview Builder like this and then we aregoing to get a context index and that'sit we also need to specify the itemcount we've used lets you Builder quitea few times so we know what to use butnow we need access to the globalvariable products so we can just type inproducts like this dot length and makesure that you import the globalvariables package from Shop app filletwhich is our own package all rightso now we have access to the productsand now we can extract one particularproduct using products at particularindexso now we have access to each of theproduct hereand now we want to design how theproduct card should look like it shouldlook like thisand I'm not going to go ahead and returnlet's say a container over here becausethis can get quite big so what I'm goingto do is extract this out in a separatewidget of its own and call this productunderscore card dot dotthen I'll import material.dotthen I'm going to have a statelesswidgetand I'm going to call this product cardall right I'm also going to return acontainerand let's go ahead and make this cardnow here you have two options to use youcan either use a card widget or acontainer which one will you use herewell you can use both of them and styleit according to the way you want but I'mgoing to go ahead with container becausecard will give me an elevation it givesme it will give me a shadow effectbehind and I don't want any of thateffect I just want a simplebox to be there with color in it so Ican just use a container for that taskand then I'm just going to go ahead andput in a child and in the child a columnand the column will have children whybecause we have three different thingshere we have the title we have the priceand then we have the products image URLokay so let's go ahead and do this sothe first thing is the text so we needthe title and the title is going to varyfor everythingso we can take it from The Constructorjust like we did with the weather apprightso we can havefinal string title then we are going torequire this through the named argumentand then I'm going to have title passedit over heregreat also since it is giving us thiswarning and I want to get rid of thiswarning I'm going to put a color overhere and the color of the container isgoing to be this particular color sowhat is this particular colorwell it can be color dot from rgbo216 240253comma 1 okay so r value is 216 G is 240253 is blue and opacity is one and if Isave this I see nothing because Ihaven't returned the product card solet's go ahead and return it over hereI'll return product card and the titleis let's say hi okay I'll save it andnothing shows up on the screen why weare expecting a list view Builder rightbut if we open the debug console I seethese errorswhy is this error well again the samething unless you build it wants to takethe entire width or our entire heightbut it's not getting the entire heightso we need to give it theamount of height we want to give it andwhat should the height be here well itshould be the entire remaining screenright we cannot give it like size box400 because then on certain screens itwill only take a level this long and oncertain screens it will take the entireheight so for this reason I am going towrap it witha widget of expanded so it will take theall amount of possible space and here wesee high perfectand we have I guess four productsreturned and even in a global variableswe have four products so that means weare doing the correct thing nicenow I'm going to go ahead and put a sizebox of height fiveand after that I'm going to put a priceso the price is going to be dollarsomething and that something is going tocome from the Constructor again so I'mgoing to final string or final doublepriceand then we're going to require thisprice so we have required this dot priceand then we can have dollar dollar pricebut now we have two dollars and itthinks we are using the dollar tohalf string interpolation So to avoidthat we are going to putslashbefore the first dollar sign so it knowsthat we are talking about the realactual dollar and then it can use stringinterpolation for dollar priceperfectnow I can save this much I come away Isee nothing because in the home page Ineed to provide a price so the priceright now can be a static value of 25.2come over here and we see dollar 25.2that's greatand the final thing I need is my imagesto show up so again I'll leave a sizebox of height 5. now how do we showimages in flutter apps that's not whatwe have seenso to do that we have the image widgetright we have this image which you canuseto display stuffand then this requires an image propertywhich requires image provider so we canpass an imageprovider here and you see it's anabstract class so again we need to use asubtype of image provider and wheneverthere is abstract class abstract classis only created in such cases becausethere are multiple types you can pass toit for example this image can be fromassets what we have mentioned in our appit can be from Network that means it'scoming from the web and you want todisplay itso there can be multiple types that'swhy the abstract classes are createdthat's why we can just search for assetimageand you can pass it over here and thisasset image requires an asset name soour asset name is going to come fromhere again so you're going to have finalstring imagerequiredthis dot image now I can take this imageput it in asset image and we're donenowwe can come herepath in an image and for image we'llhave to use this product so we can goahead and use product image URLas string all right we need to use asstring over here becausein global variables products is definedas list of map of string comma object itthinks it's an objectnot a particular valueor not dynamic so that's why we need totell it that yeah we are sure that thisis a stringand we can do the same things over heresince we've already done it productprice as double andproducttitle as string rightnow we can come over here and we see ourimages are showing up nicely and it isscrollableso that's good now first thing we needto do is make sure the height isconstrained it's not whatever it wantsto be so let's go ahead anduse itso an asset image we cannot specify theheight but an imagewe do have a property of height so wecan go ahead and pass the height aslet's say 175 if we do that it will onlytake as much height as we tell it to allrightgreatnow instead of using image like thisa smaller option can be image dot assetthen you directly mention the assetand you can also specify the height overhereand you're done so this is just ashorter option of doing the same thingyou can use itbecause it's the same image widget thatwe are using but now it hasdot asset to it attachedso it is a Constructor thing and it justsimplifies a task if we want it to andyou'll see no difference over hereperfectnow we do have a white patch over hereand that white batch is visible overhere as well and that's simply becauseof the image we've chosen the image islike this that's why we are getting thewhite patch okay great now that we haveimage.asset in place the next thing Iwant to do is increase the height of allof these thingsso I want a particular textile for thisthing so what I'm going to do isgeneralize it in main.dot for text themeright so I'll come over here and addtext themethis allows me to pass in typographyor theming of text all right now I canpass in the text themes I want to useand I'm doing this because I want toreuse mytitles everywhere I use all right so ifI am using a text title over here I wantthat particular theme to be used in someothertext theme as well that is why I'mmentioning it over here you'll see itlater on as we reuse these text themesthe main point of me doing all of thisand setting up the text theme over hereis just reusabilityI can change the text theme from oneparticular place and it will reflect allover the app that's what I wantso anyways I'll go ahead and mentiontitle medium which is what I'm going tospecify forthis thing over your title mediumso the textile here is going to be fontweight font weight dot bold because Iwant it bolded and the fontssize I want to use the size so the fontsize will be 20. quite small because ourmain title this title over here is 35.so I want it smaller than that and muchsmaller than thatand now if I do that there's no visiblechanges over here because this text ison its own it doesn't inherit theproperties I've defined over here so Iwant to make sure that it inherits thoseproperties or you know just startstaking those properties not inheritsbut starts taking those properties so Iam going to put style and that will betheme dot off contextso you see the context is helping usaway ato find the particular widget in thewidget tree that's what we had discussedright context will always help us tolocate a particular widget that's why weare passing the context over here andeven if we go to the function definitionyou'll find inherited theme is equal tocontext it uses the context to find theparticular inherited widget of that typeso it uses context to find anotherwidget of the same type this is wherecontext can help so here I am going todo theme dot of context dot text themeDotand here what is the style admissiontitle medium so I'm going to mentiontitle medium here perfect and when I dothatit looks good perfectnow what I want to do is set the stylefor this dollar 44.52 as wellso let's go ahead and the main.dot fileand here I'm going to mentioneither title small or body small you canuse whatever and please note that thesefont sizes like title medium body smallthese are used by certain widgetswhen they want to set up text forexample Abba Abba uses one of theproperties from your like title Lodge todisplay text on the screenso text theme has a bunch of valuesalready there you can see it over hereif we don't don't mention anythingthey have a style of their own but if wedo mention it it will override thoseexisting stuff and app bar like widgetsso for example if I put app bar texttext uses this text themes property liketitle Lodge to display stuff on thescreen I'm going to share it to you whenwe go to the product details screenyou'll see that okayso we come over here set up body smallnow you can set anything but I'm settingit body small because I wantthe body to be small everywhere so I canhave textileand font weight can be font weight dotbold again and font size can be 16. soit's smaller than the title medium butit's still smallnow I can come over here I'll copy thestyle I'll paste it for the price butinstead of title medium I'm going tohave body small okay now if I come overhere dollar 44.52 this is niceGrayso we have all of this set up but stillthere are problemsif you compare it with your there aremany problems so the first problem Iwant to fixis the alignment issue so everything isin the center I want everything to be inthe left hand sideso in the column I'm going to set thecross access alignment obviously I wantit in the startand it's a columnso I'll have cross access alignment dotstart we'll save it and everythingshifts over herebut I still want padding to be presentso what will I doI'll wrap this column in a paddingwidgetI hope you're getting the hang of itwhatever you can think of this is what Iwant to do you can display it on thescreenso I just thought that I wanted this tobe a little bit away from everythingfrom the left from the top so I just usethe padding widget it should comeintuitively to younow instead of all I can haveagencies.all 16 and this looks betternow the problem here is the image isn'tcenteredI want it to be in the center I don'twant it in the left hand side just afterthe padding is done noso what I'm going to do here iswrap the image in a centeryou can use align property you can usesome other thing you can think of butI'm going to go ahead and Center it andyeah that's easythe next thing I want to do is make surethat I leave some space from here youseethere is space between every card andthere is spacefrom the device width as wellso again we'll have to use the marginproperty of the container since we arein a container we don't have to wrapanythingso I can just do that so I'll havemargin agent sets Dotall 20.also I can put Constable save it andthere we go perfectnow you might think hey since youalready have a container why are weusing a padding over here why can't wejust take this padding and push it overhere and then you can remove the widgetyou can remove the widget by doing sosave it and yeah things are still thesame if you thought this way thencongrats you're becoming a betterflutter developeryou have your Basics nailed down sincewe already have a container there'smargin property and there's also paddingand I've already explained thedifference between the margin andpadding to youso we don't need the extra paddingwidget now if you put it there's no harmbut why do you want multiple widgetswhen one widget can do it for yousweet the next thing I want isthe border to be curved and that shouldmake my entire app betterso how do I make this curveddoes container have a property for thatnot really there's no order relatedpropertybut we do have something known asdecorationand this requires decoration which isagain an abstract classso you can't instantiate it however youcan use box decoration which isgenerally used with flutterso you can use that over here andbox decoration will allow you to pass ina color which you've already done butyou'll see why we need a color over herethen we have an image that we can passin yep we can pass a container imagethen border border radius border radiusis what we want we want to put that nicecurvesso we can put thatand now we can have border radius dotcircular 20.again tried and tested values you canjust keep using it and now we see anerror as soon as we provide borderradius it is giving me an error why solet's try to remove water radius and Cif I remove water radius I still havethis errorso this has something to do with boxdecoration if I remove box decorationand save the errors go away now thiserror is there becauseyou have defined a color over here andthen you've also defined decorationnow if decoration is mentioned then youhave to shift the color from outside toinsideand then the error goes away however ifyou haveno box decoration or decorationmentioned you only want a colorthen that's fine too but both can't bethere decoration and color in acontainer cannot be passed the color hasto be moved inside the Box decorationfor it to work now you might ask whydoes container have a color property ifbox decoration also has a color propertyand that's because box decoration isn'tjust used for container it is used forliterally everydecoration property so if some otherwidget requires decoration property anda decoration classyou can pass box decoration to it andthen you can also specify the coloralso since it requires decorationsomething that extends decoration can bepath steer so it's not necessarily boxdecoration Maybeyou want something else some otherdecoration typeand you can see that over here someother decoration can be known over herelike shape decoration all rightthat's why color was mentioned over hereso yeah the point is if color is definedin container you cannotuse decoration and if you want to usedecoration Define both of them insideit's also written in box decoration overhere if you scroll down if color is nullthis decoration does not paint thebackground colorif image is null this decoration doesnot paint a background image and it doesso on and on okayso let's restart and we come over hereand our app is looking similar not thesame why is it not looking the samewell that's becausethe colors are different the first cardis this exact color but the second cardis a different colorand this color if you notice this coloris quite similar to this colorso we need to use this exact colorand we need the background color tochange how should it change well if Ijust open the app for youthe first one is blue second one iswhite third one is blue again fourth oneis white so this is the pattern we wanthow can we have this so to generalize oneven stuff we wantblue color otherwise we want white coloron even stuff as in the index should beeven so this was zero so it wasconsidered evenso we could mention blue color but assoon as it became indexed as one itbecame odd that's why it has abackground color of whiteso we are going to ask for the productcard color here so we are going to havefinal color background color and thiswill be required through the Constructornow we can take this background colorpass it to The Container colorsave itcome to the home page you havebackground color pass to it then you'llhave productbut product does not have any backgroundcolor how do you how will you make surethat product has a background color sothis is the reason whywe have to do something like this so weneed to check if index is evenso if index is even that means it is 0 24 6 8 10.then what do we want to do so if indexis even I want to give it a particularcolor if index is odd then I want togive it the white color so that's what Iwant to doso I can just have if index is even thenI'm going to have constant color dotfrom rgbothen I'm going to have 216 240 253 1.otherwise index is not even then I'mgoing to have constant color dot fromRGB again but this will be 245 247 249.1 what we've used before all rightthis is the same color we use for thechip earlier you can see it over hereso anyways we have this setup and nowyou can see the clear difference now ourapp is looking much better perfectso this looks greatthe next thing we need is this Bottombar and we can add that later on butfirst what I want to focus on iswhenever I click on this product theproduct Details page should appearso to show you a real demo if I selectthis one I click over here the titleappears the image appears thensome different coloredbox appears with the price the availablesizes and the add to cart buttonso I want to design this so let's goahead and design it so we are going togo ahead in the lip folder and createproduct underscore details underscorepage dot dotnow I'm going to right click over hereand close others so it will close allthe other files over here so I have onlyone file to focus on then I'll importmaterial.dot againthen I will create a state less switcherand I'm going to call this productdetailspagethen again we are going to return ascaffold and now I want to test how thislooks all right so how can I test itwell for that I can just take thisproduct details I can go to the main Dotand replace home page with productDetails page to see the thing rightso yeah we do see an empty screenalso it is continuously showingperforming hot reload for iPhone so I'mjust going to exit that process and I'mgoing to select iOS here againand then going to run it so that shouldhopefully work and while that ishappening let's go ahead and design theproduct Details page so the first thingwe need is an app bar which just saysdetailsso we are going to go and have an appbar title constant text which saysdetailssave it and we see details over herewith the yellow backgroundand that yellow background is therebecause we have set primary color tothis yellow colorSo to avoid that yellow color what I cando is go to the main dot dot and youhave set up the global theme for my appbar my app bar should look the same onevery screen so I'm going to set up theapp bar theme over here which I canobviously change from here as well butI'm going to do it here because I wantit for every app bar so I'm going tohave an ABBA theme which is going tohave first of all a title textile so thetextile is going to befont size 20 so I wanted a little bitbigger and the color should be colorsdot blackokay because this is white as of nowand doing this much the colorchanges the next thing I want is it forit to be transparentand in my opinion it is not transparentbecause we have not said use material 3to true so we want to make sure that itis set to true and you see everythingchangesalso if we come back to the home pageover here let's put home as home pageand we come here nothing really changesover here things are still the samewhat has changed is the app bar is nowso first of all let's just change itagain product Details page app bar isnow white in color perfectthen we want the title men's Nike shoesor whatever so for that we'll have toget access to the product so we aregoing to take it from The Constructorand have final string object which isproductand then I'm going to require it throughthe Constructor so I've required thisdot productthen I'm going to have a bodythe body is going to have a columncolumn is going to have children and thefirst child is going to be text whichsays productat particular title which is going to betreated as a stringcool now if we come to the mean dot dotyou see we have to pass in a Constructorhere and the Constructor is a product solet's go ahead and pass in we are goingto import products from theGlobal variables.dot file and then I'mgoing to access the zeroth element nowit says invalid constant value becausethis isn't a constantthis is a global variable that canchange so we can have a constant removeand there we goso we have men's Nike shoes written overhere nowdon't be concerned about products atzerowe're just passing product Details pageaware so that we can take a look at howto design the page and after that I'lltell you how to navigate from one pageto another okay so let's go to theproduct Details page herenow what I want to do is set the stylefor this men's Nike shoes thingand if you notice that thisfont size and this font style the fontweight and the font size both are verysimilar to what we had in the shoescollectionboth are of equal height both have theequal font weight so both of them arequite the same sowhat I'm going to do and what's going onin my mind is what if I go in the homepage I copy this textileI go to the main dot dotand then I'm going to have a title Lodgeand I'm going to paste this as a textileso the font weight is bold the font sizeis 35now I can come to the home page and I'mgoing to have theme dot of context dottext themeDottitle largeso with this I'll have to removeconstant I'll have to set constant forthis part for this part but the textstyle is no longer constant because itis theme dot off contextgreat now why have I done this I'vemoved this to the global theme and setit to title lodge becausethat's what I want for title Lodge andnow I can reuse this component easily byjust copying this thingso this textile can be applied to anytext I want to apply it to this textI'll just pass in the style as thisthing over heresave it and there we go men's Nike shoesshows up and it's looking really goodthe next thing I want is the image butbefore that I want spacing to be presentand the thing about spacing and thetricky part about spacing is this if Icome back to the normal appif I have this kind of thing the spacingshould decreasebutif I have this kind of shoe the spacingshould increase so it's relative spacingright I can't give a fixed value overhere otherwise I'll get render flowerror because this shoe is quite bigso if I put let's say a size box ofheight 50 and your I put a size box ofheight 50 again that will work but if Iput a size box of height 50 over herethis shoe will go on the topthen I'll have size box of height 50again and this container will come rightover there so it's not consistent UIbasically and our spacing wire requiresrelative spacing so for that particularreason there's another widget that willhelp us to space stuff out and that isthe spacer widgetso if I pass constant spacer like thisthe spacer requires something known as aflexso anytime you use spacer it will createa flex of one on your screen and it willrelatively lay it outso to show it in a diagram form let'ssay this is my screenlet's say I havemy text widget over here then I want toleave some space so I can just leavesome space here this will create a flexof one then I have suppose my image somy image is showing up like this thenI'll again havea spacer so spacer will be like thisthis will also create a flex of one andthis will be relative positioningmeaningthe spacing will be carried out likethis by performing a calculation thatthere are total flexes on the screen isequal to 2.so each Flex is going to take a size of1 by 2 on the entire screensince the number of flexes on the screenis 2this space is going to be 1 by 2 andthis space is going to be 1 by 2. sothey equally divide themselves if I addone more let's sayFlex let's add one more Flex over herethe total Flex will be3 and each Flex will take 1 by 3. now aweird thought comes in what if I wantone of my spacing to take double thespace of anotherwhat if I don't want second spaceand this Flex should be bigger all rightit should be twice the heightof how much this Flex is takingso what will happen I can specify a flexproperty to it you see we have Flexso this can be flexors too this will beFlex as one so the total Flex is 3 butthis will take one third of theavailable space and this will take twothird of the available spacethat's how flexes work if you don'tunderstand this I'm going to demonstratea practical example to you but that wasjust a diagram so now I've created aflex of onenow I'm going to use image.assic todisplay my image again and that will beproductat image URLand we are going to take this as astringsave it and we come over hereour image is showing up and this is theprevious appwe'll get to this app and our image isshowing right at the bottom not badbecause what has happened over here isthe total Flex is onesince the total Flex over here is 1it says hey I'll take one out of onespace so it takes all the availablespace however if I add another spacerwhat happens isthere are two flexors on the screen thisthing right here and this thing righthere so this takes one by twoand this also takes one by twoso both of them take 50 50 of theavailable screen space but that is notcoolbecause it's simple this should be onethis should be two because this imageshould go more upso your will pass and flex as to save itcome over here this looks good enoughthe next thing I want to do is wrap thisimage with a paddingso I can do that I can wrap this with apadding widgetand then I'm going to have Edge and saysdot all 16.and this looks betterI'm not going to specify any heightwidth Etcafter this what I want is a container ifyou can see over hereWhat's Happening Here is there's acontainer which has its own backgroundcolor you can see it over here then ithas its own text with the price then theavailable spy sizes you can select fromand then an add to card button so weneed these three components in thiscolorso what will you use here and how willyou lay it out well we can use it in acolumn first of all that's a good thingto clear off so let's go ahead andcreate a container down below so we'regoing to have containerdecoration box decorationthen I'll mention a color so the coloris going to be constantcolor dot from rgbo and it's going to bethe same color that we had used earlierfor the chip for the second box that wasoddI mean the box that had evenor odd indexso we're going to have 245247249 and 1.after mentioning the color what I'mgoing to do ismention the width as well so the widthover here let's say is 250 I'll save itand I see nothing on the screen whybecause I mentioned the width thecontainers with doesn't really matterhere the height matters because thecontainer is getting the maximum widthbecause column is taking the maximumwidth now because it is in thescaffold's bodyso I can set the height as 250and you see a container has risen abovewhere and that looks solid perfectthen I want to make this curved if yousee over here this is also curved so Iwant this container to be curved as wellso that's why I had set up boxdecorationso I can use your border radius and theBorder radius will be border radius dotcircular 20 let's saycome over hereand it's hard to see but the Borderradius isn't quite enoughso I'll set it to 40.and I think this is quite like it so Ilike it this way that's good now afterthe containers decoration has been donewe can go to the child again columnI hope you're becoming experts in UI itis so intuitive in my opinion you know Iwant everything vertically I can use acolumn if I want everything horizontallyI can use a row if I want to put itemsin a list I can use a list view Builderif I want to display a text I can usetext for an image image.asset so I hopeyour understanding and getting the hangof thingsthen I'm going to mention texture andthe text is going to be well slashdollar dollarthen I'll have to mention productpricelike thiscool so we have dollar 44.52 showing upbut this now takes only this much spaceI want to take the entire width so forthat particular reason I can have doubledot infinity or even if you don'tmention the width it's fine because wehave a list of sizes to displaywhen we have a list of dial sizes todisplay we will be using list viewBuilder becausewe don't know how many items we aregoing to have it's not one particularvalueit can be 9 10 11 12 for one product itcan be eight nine ten for one product itcan be six nine twelve for one productso the sizes can vary and number ofitems can vary that's why I'm using alist view Builderwhen the number of items is not knownyou can use list view Builder when thenumber of items are known then you mightwant to use list view we have not takena look at list view but let's do thesame as listview Builder instead ofpassing an item count item Builder youjust have to pass in children just likea column and just mention stuff in itso anyways we have product pricewhat I want to do ismake sure this text is big enough and ifyou notice this text is as big enough asthis oneso we're just going to have a style oftheme dot of context Dottext themeDottitle launchif I save this dollar 44.52 shows upand nowin my column the next thing I'll do isleave a height I'm not using spacer overhere notice that I'm using a size boxbecause this isn't relative heightit doesn't really matter if my height isrelatively spaced or not in terms ofimages it did matter because I wantedconsistent UIso anyways we have a size box here thatlooks goodso we'll have a height of 10.and after that we are going to have alist view Builder that will tell us allthe available sizesso we are going to have listview Builderwith an item Builder context and indexthen you are going to have item countand the item count is going to beproduct sizes dot lengthnow if we go to Global variables productsizes so we are doing the correct thingbut we are calling dot length propertyon an object so obviously we need totreat this asa list of double but if we use it aslist of double then it will give us anerror like this why because you'reseeing list of double dot length you'renot saying product sizes as list doubledot length Okay so you need to wrap itwith the apparent thesis and then you'redone okaynow you can extract one particular sizeso you have final size which is equal toproductat sizesat particular indexand here it's saying you cannotinvokethis thing this index unconditionallybecause it thinks that product sizes canbe an object which is nullable so whatI'm going to do here istell them that yeah this can never benull and then access the index propertyon it but then also I cannot accessindex property because there's nothinglike add index on an objectso we need to again treat this assomething so we're going to have asdoublethenI'm going to take this as a wholealso this will be list of double andthen you'll have access to index so whatI've done here is the same thing productat sizes as list double and then I'mcalling at index to get one particularsize and now I want to return it so I'mgoing to return chipand then the label which will be textsize dot to string perfectnow we'll save this become aware and weget an error the error is there becauseit is saying that list of integer is nota subtype of list of double so itconsiders these sizes to be all integerand that is true as of now everything isinteger but so let's go ahead and usethat particular thing so we are going tohave as list of integer list of integersince everything over here size is 9 1012 9 10 12 it cannot have a decimalvalue right that's why it is an integernow you can just have list of endand you seeour UI is not distorted the error goesaway but it is all distorted and it'sagain thanks to the list view Builderagain list view Builder wants to takethe entire screen size it's not gettingthat so it's just distorting our UI andgiving us a bunch of Errors again wrapthis in either expanded orsized box I'm going to wrap it in sizebox whyvery simplesize box will give at a particularheight of 50so it is constraintsin that particular height all rightand it can't grow bigger than thatAlso let's set the scroll direction asaccess dot horizontal and everything isand horizontal Directionafter that I'm just going to wrap mychip widget with padding widget and I'mgoing to have Edge and such dot all 8and everything is evenly spaced out thatlooks coolafter this we finally need add to cartbutton and we are donealso I think this dollar 44.52 is rightup we have to center it but we can dothat after we add a button so againlet's go ahead and leave a size box ofheight 10then I'm going to have elevated buttonvery simple I'm not going to use textbutton and the child is going to betext which says add to cartsave it also we are going to putconstant come aware we have add to cartbutton but now we need to style it firstwe need a background color then we needto set the size for it and after that wemight have to change the color of thetext because the color of the textinside of it is yellow we want to changeit to Blackso let's go ahead we are going to havestyle which will be elevated button dotstyle fromthen we want to set the background colorwe've already taken a look at the buttonso much it's justa revisit for you I hopeso now the background color should beyellow and it's yellow because theoverall theme of my app is yellow so nowI just want to set it to theme dot offcontext dot color scheme dot primarycolorso with this it has a primary color ofwhat we have defined yellow now I wantthe minimum size to be therethe minimum size of this button shouldbe this much and otherwise it can takewhatever it wants so it will be doubledot infinity and height will be 50.then we can save it come over hereand here is a button add to cart buttonhas disappeared and that's because thatwas already yellow so let's change itback to black so we are going to set thestyle over here which will be textilecolor will be colors dot blackandfont size will be 18. let's just makethe font size a little bit bigger thislooks goodnow we need some spacing from here rightso obviouslywe need padding I hope that stuck yourmind you know this is a way to know thatyou're progressingthen you have agencies.all let's say 10not enough let's try 20good enoughbut the width or the height between bothof them has increased and it hasincreased because we have a size box ofheight 10 over here then we haveagencies.all 20 so that means thespacing from here till here is 20 plus10 which is 30.and from all the other sides it's 20.that's why what I'm going to do isremove the size box height so from allthe places it is 20 and it looks betterand final thing for the UI here isI want everything to be in the center soI'll just access the main column and setit to main access alignment Dot Centerand there we go this looks awesomethe next thing in this screen what Iwant to do is whenever I select aproduct I can select a size for it andwe've already done this with the chipwidgetthe same thing I want to do over here aswell with the sizingso I recommend you to try this on yourown and make sure that your logic iscorrect and what you're doing is correctso that you have more confidence inyourselfso pause the video and try it foryourselfI hope you were able to do it foryourself now let's try it togetherwhat I'm going to do first of all isconvert the stateless to a statefulwidget then I'm going to haveend selected size is equal to0 let's say so the selected size is 0 atfirstthen I take the selected sizeso I have in selected size equal to 0then I'll scroll downhere where did it go the chip yep yeahI'm going to have a background color ofselected size is equal equal to size soif it really does match my size then I'mgoing to select one thingso let's sayif it is selected then the color istheme dot off context dot color schemedot primary colorotherwise it is all going to be nullokaythat's nice if the background color isnull that means it takes the defaultcolor that is already given to itand we get this kind of error now solet's just restart and there we go thereare is fixed to fix it on Androidemulator we'll click over here restartand it will startokay cool now if I select anything stillnothing happens because we have notupdated the value of selected size sowhat we need to do is wrap the chipwidget with a gesture detector we arenot going to wrap the padding widgetwith gesture detector and I've alreadymentioned the reason to younow uh in the on top I'm going to haveset State don't forget that and selectedsize should be equal to sizethe size we have extracted over hereand now if I select anything it isselected perfectnow what I want to do is come back tothe main dot dot I'llmention home page over hereand this should be a constant I'll comeat the top and remove product detailsand Global variables from herenow what I want to do actually iswhenever the user clicks on oneparticular product I want to navigatethem from one screen to another how willI do that well that opens up to a NewConcept and flutter which is Navigatorlet's talk about it and how it works solet's dive in the code for it we aregoing to close all the files here andI'm going to go to one particular pagewhich is the home page where I have justone thingif I scroll down the product cardso I want the product card to be wrappedwith the gesture detector and whenever Iclick on that product cardI want to get navigated from one screento anotherso first of all let's go ahead and wrapit with gesture detectorthen we are going to have on tap you seethere are lots of options gesturedetector provides as well but we'regoing to go ahead with on tap and thenon tap what do we want to do well wewant to navigate from home page toproduct Details page now since we havethat much Clarity it's easier for us whywe just have to do Navigator dot offagain or Navigator dot off also usesinherited widget behind the scenes andcontext is used to find ancestor Stateancestor State againso context is helping us find thenearest Navigatorand using that NavigatorI can navigate from one page to anotherthen after doing Navigator dot off I geta bunch of properties over here Focusnode overlay but that's not what I'minterested in what I'm interested in ismethods like pop pushpop and push name so let's go over themone by one so first one is pop pop isbasically popping off the screennow to understand this you'll have tounderstand how Navigator really workslet's remove this diagram and draw adiagram for navigatorthink of Navigator as a stack all rightwhat is the stack well let's just thinkof it asa pile of books on a desk all right solet's just consider this is a deskand then you have a bunch of books ontop of it so there is one bookall right then there is another book ontop of itand then another book on top of it okaythis is how Navigator works it works onthe concept of Stack this is a stackanything that's above one another is astackand justas a general information stack is also awidget in flutter that will help you tobuild uis so it has children pass to itso you can pass one particular widgetwhich will be the background and afterthatthe next widget you pass in will beabove it so if you have text hi then youhave texthellothat will just make sure that there iskind of this thing so let's just havethis CChiis there you won't be able to see it butyou see H is kind ofbolded that's becausehi and hello are there so H isoverlappingso basically high is below helloso it is stacking up so in this casehigh is this thing hello is this thingand the eyes are over here this is youreyes right if these are your eyesand you're looking from your to bottomwhat will you see you'll first see Hellothen you'll see hi right and that's whyso this is the general concept of stackstack is also a data structureso basically this is the concept onwhich Navigator works whenever you callthings like popit just pops off and removes off thetopmost screen it will just pop off andremove off the topmost screen well howdo you add screens on the top that wouldbe the biggest questionwell for thatyou use Navigator dot off context dotpush so what push does is it has onewidget it will just stack it aboveanother again you push something fromOne widget to another it will just putit on top of another widget so this isour push works and pop just removes of aparticular widgetjust think in terms of our array rightit also works on the concept of Stackright if you use twoand then you use add function to add thenumber three it will add it to the lastthen you use push to add four so youwill be adding 4 to our array and thenwhen you want to remove something or popsomethingit will remove it from the last unlessyou specify what kind ofpage you want to or what kind of numberyou want to remove so it's kind of likea list but in general it is called stackokay so now I want to call Push becauseI want to push it now here's anotherimportant concept which is of this thingpushreplacementso what push replacement does is if youcall navigator.off context dot pushreplacement from this screenit will replace this entire screen witha different screen altogether so this isout of the picture now now if you callPop after that it will pop this screenand will give you the screen backso replace push replacement justreplaces the entire thing entirely itjust removes it from the stackwith itselfand then when you call pop it will justpop this thingso I hope you understood thatnow we have Push replacement here notpush replacement I want Push and whatpush requires here is something known asrouteand generally what we pass over here ismaterial page routeor a Cupertino page routeor something that basically extends matiuh just a page route all right so youhave page route Builder that you canpass away or anything that has orextends page routing why do we have todo this well it's boilerplate code butwe have to do material page routebecause what you're doing istrying to add a platform adaptivetransition hereso moving from one screen to anotherlooks different on different devicesand those are transitions the way theydo it on iOS it might be different fromfor iOS it might be different that's whyso you need to mention material pagerouting and here you can mention moresettings but I hardly ever use any ofthemthen it requires Builderthat requires a context or that givesthe context which you can useso we have this and here what do we haveto pass well we have to return a widgetfrom here what Widget the widget youwant to transition to you want to moveto so I want to move to the productdetails screen so I'm going to return itfrom hereand I'm also going to pass in theproduct that I have extracted hereperfect now if I save it I'll restart myappand when I click over here I go to theparticular product if I click over hereI go to Adidas shoesif I click over here I go to Batawomen's shoes now I know the images areincorrect but forgive me for that thisis just about learningall the images and illustrations usedhere are incorrect I knowso we can close this and yeah this workswellnow just to demonstrate what I wastalking if I use replace surveyornot replace push replacementthen what will happen is when I clickover here I won't be able to go backwhen I try to go back I won't be able toon Android emulator to go back I have toclick this when I try to do that I won'tbe able to do obviouslyonly when Iclick over herewhen I try to go back I just exit theappagain when I try to open the app youknow I just go back that is howreplacement works I won't be able to goback from the screenso obviously push replacement is neededand stuff like let's say Authenticationso when you have logged in you don'twant the user to go back to the loginscreen that's whyyou use push replacement that time notpush but in scenarios like this push isvery much needed and you also notice thedifference over here all right let'shave iPhone simulator hot restart when Iclick over here and when there's push Iget the back button however when thepush button is not thereit's push replacement then I don't getany back buttonso I hope that was clear and I hope youunderstand what the code for navigatoris it's Navigator dot off context thenyou either want to push push replacementpop and there are a bunch of otherthings like push and remove untilthere's push named which is related tonamed routes but we'll get to it when westart building stuff for the entire weball rightwhen we make our layoutgood enough for all the screen sizes sowe have push here then we have Pushpop and push restorable push all of thatstuff but the most commonly used is pushpush replacement and Pop I don't thinkyou're going to need anything other thanthose 90 of the times obviously so nowthat we have understood this I just wantto clear how Navigator worksso in flutter the Navigator is actuallyresponsible for managing the navigationstack and handling the transitionsbetween different screens or routes inan applicationwe passed in a material page route andthat handles the navigation you see whenI click over here I get a transitionwhich goes from right to left but onAndroid it goes from bottom to topyou seenot even bottom to top it's kind of likea fade animationso it is platform adaptive based on whatplatform it is on it will perform thatnavigation or that transitionand whenever we call Navigator dot offcontext we're basically using inheritedwidget it Returns the nearest Navigatorwidgetin the widget tree that contains thebuild contextexactly like theme Right In theme alsoit would go up the widget tree findingtheme class and it would inherit or takeproperties from it same thing ishappening for navigator it is going upthe widget tree trying to find Navigatornow you might say hey everyone we havenevercreated any Navigator stuff over hereand that's true you've never done it butmaterial app hasmaterial app behind the scenes creates anavigator class which you can find whenyou just try to look over here all rightyou'll be able to find stuffso material app does it for younow behind the scenes Navigatormaintains a stack of Route objects whichI told you about which represent thedifferent screens or routes in yourapplication I'm saying different screensor routes because sometimes you mightnot want to return a screen when you goto a particular or when you useNavigator what you want to show is let'ssay a half screen dialogsomething like an alert dialog boxsomething like that so even thenNavigator can help you and thosesettings over here which are present fornavigatorin the material page route can help youlike full screen dialogue maintain Stateall of thatso those are different routes butusually you'll be encountering differentscreens because to create a dialogue apop-up you have several other thingsnow when you navigate to a new screenyou push a new route onto the stack soif you want one particular screen solet's say I have my home page over herethat's the home screen now I want topass product details so I'm going topass it at the top over hereso I push it on top of the stack andthis is what happens when you navigateback for example when I click over hereand when I go back when I click on thisback buttonnavigator.op is called all right andthen you navigate backfrom year to year so behind the scenesnavigator.off context Dotpop is called so it goes back towhatever screen it came fromso just to summarize if you'veunderstood you can skip this partwhenever you call Navigator dot offcontext it looks for the nearestNavigator widget in the given treeand this is typically provided bymaterial or Cupertino app right at thetop of the widget a hierarchya root widget once it finds a navigatorwidget it returns an instance of theNavigator statenow this Navigator state is the thingthat allows us to manipulate thenavigation stack so if you go tonavigator.off context you'll see staticNavigator state so this Navigator stateis the thingthat does most of our workand it allows us to manipulate thenavigation stack so with the navigate astate object now you can perform variousnavigation operations like we sawwhenever we call Navigator dot offcontext it gives us the Navigator Statenow with this Navigator State we cancall push poppush replacementall of those stuff when you push a newroutethe Navigator animates or transitionsfrom the previous route to the new routeusing transition animation which arealready predefined for platforms onAndroid it is likea fade in transition and for iOS it is asliding transitiontransitions are there so that itprovides a smooth visual effect itdoesn't go like hey you suddenly changethe screen and you get to know thatthese are two different screensit just is a smooth process and when youpop her out from the stack the Navigatorreverses the animation bringing back theprevious route so when you click overhere you see we haveright to left and when we click back itis left to right so it just reverses thetransitionso I hope you understood how Navigatorworks and this is how anything that hasdot off context will workbecause they are using inherited widgetand that is the biggest conceptin State Management once you understandthat you'll be understandingNavigatorscaffold messenger that we'll take alook atand many State Management tools as welland I hope you're also understanding theimportance of build contextBill context is making sure behind thescenes that you can find the correctNavigator State widgetbecause just think about it even in theflutter source code the flutter sourcecode is so big and if you want to accessfrom One widget to another there mightbe some way of communication right youcan't just keep going through theConstructor and keep passing everythingfor stuff like these product Detailspage Constructor is finebecause it's just one product that youwant to display and storing it in astate management tool is just stupidhoweverin stuff like add to cartusing State Management is required forexample if I have a bottom navigationbarrierand when I click over thereI should see the card page so that meansI go to the product Details pageI click on add to cart and it should addit to my cart pagethink of it in form of a widget tree ifit's hard to visualize just draw it outand see or I can do it for you you haveyour root widgetthen you have your material appthen after the material app you have thehome pagethen after the home page there's anotherwidget you could take which is the cartpage right home page and card page areshown differently as of nowso if you click one item like the cartbuttonin the bottom barfor exampleover herewhen you click the cart item you shouldbe seeing card products so there are twooptions you can take now in the homepage if you click on something you cango to the product Details pagenow my cardor my add to cart button is mentionedinside of this particular widget whichis the product Details page so what Iwant to do is whatever I click over hereshould be added to a listand that list should be accessible in aseparate widget as well how do we dothathow can I make sure that stuff passesfrom Child widget to parent widget fromparent widget to its parent widget andthen it can pass it to its siblingthis is quite a cumbersome process youcan do it in flutter but it's quitecumbersome so instead of doing that whatI'm going to do is introduce StateManagement which usually does somethinglike thisyou shift everything down then the StateManagement tool will createa storehouse for itself right at the topof the widget tree and hereyou store all the dataand this is what state management is youstore all the data over hereso what you do isadd to cart from your to your thechanges are made over here and then youcontinuously listenfrom the card screen to this particularscreenor this particular storehouseso just to summarize if you didn'tunderstand whenever I click on add tocart button in my app over here itshould be displayed over here so whatI'm going to do is whenever add to cartbutton is clicked on I'm going to updateand store all the data in one particularState Management tool which will be thehead of everythingand whenever I want to read data I'mgoing to read everything from this StateManagement tool or the storehouse itselfso if I make changes over hereI can read it instantlyif I make deletions updating any stuffit will automatically be received overhere this particular tool will do thatso this is what we are going to do inState Management I hope you understoodthe conceptbecauseI'm not going to explain it again I'vealready explained that now we'll see itin the form of code but before that westill have to get done with the UI andwhat I want to create is a bottom barwirewhich tells you hey do you want toaccess cart you can access card fromhere so let's go ahead and do that solet's go ahead and add bottom navigationbar to both of these thingsso let's just close all the save filesfrom here go to thehome pageand here we are going to set up ourbottom navigation bar because wheneverwe return a scaffold we get body we getthe Abba property and we also get afooter kind of thing which is the bottomnavigation bar this bottom navigationbar accepts a widget so you can passanything over here but there is aspecial widget for bottom navigation barwhich is bottom navigation bar itselfhere there's a required argument ofitems that you need to pass in and itshould be a list of bottom navigationbar item so we're going to copy this putit in the listand then we're going to use that sowe're going to have bottom navigationbar itemand here we're going to have pass in aniconand that's pretty much all there thereisso the item we want over here or theicon we want at first is icons dot homeso I want the home icon to be thereand the second item that I require isbottom navigation bar item which isshopping bag or shopping cart whateveryou want to use I'll go ahead and useshopping cartthen you can save it also put aconstable here because both of theseitems are constant so the list becomes aconstantand when you come over here you stillsee this error and this error isbasically saying that item.label is notequal to null so that means the labelproperty should be added somewhere wherein bottom navigation bar item eventhough this is nullable it does requirea label to be passed in but what if Idon't want to pass any label it shouldbe nothing so I'll just pass in an emptylabel herein both of these things and the errorgoes away I see my bottom navigation bargreatnow what I want to do is whenever Iclick any of themI want to navigate to that particularscreenso for that reason I am going to createa functionor let's not create a function I am justgoing to create a variable that willkeep track of the current page so wehave the current page at zero now I cancopy this current pageand here in the bottom navigation bar werequire two things on tap and currentindex so we can pass in the currentindex which will be current page so thisis the correct index so this is theitem that we have selected also hereyou'll have to pass an i in current pageis equal to one and then when yourestart the app you seethis thing is active nowand the home is the zeroth element orthe zeroth page so yeahjust restart the app and you'll see thedifferenceso now whenever this item is beingtapped on we want to change the currentpage so that will reflect those changesright so for that we can use the ontapproperty given by bottom navigation baror alternative option was to wrap thisbottom navigation bar itemwith the gesture detector but that isn'tallowed because this wants a list ofbottom navigation bar items you cannotput a gesture detector here becausegesture detector is a widget notparticularly bottom navigation bar itemonlyso let's go ahead and pass the on taphere and the on Tab will have a value weare going to set State and we are goingto set the state of current page equalto the value this will give usand then what I'm going to do is Clickover here you see there is a smoothchange over here so we are able tochange the item in theapp but still we are not able to figureouthow to change the screen how do I showthis particular cart page for thisparticular home screenor how do I show the home page on thehome screen or when the home screen isactive and how do I show cart page whenthis is activeso to do that I'll have to do one thingI'll have to extract the entire body outin a separate widget of its own so let'scopy this entire widget and let's callthis product listso we are going to have in the libfolder a file product underscore listdot dot then we are going to importmaterial.dotand then we are going to create astateless widgetwhich will be product list and here I amgoing to returnthis entire widget I'll make sure youunderstand the purpose but as of nowjust follow along also this requires aborder to be passed in and this is theBorderwe are basically taking a widget outfrom here and putting it in its separateown Widget the reason for that I'llmention in just a minutealso we want filters so we'll have toconvert this product list to a statefulwidget because all the chip and filterstuff is inside of itand then we can take this final stringfilters out put it in a list come backover herethen you're going to have a selectedfilter then we are going to have ourinit State and then I'm just going topass in my product list like this okayso I've successfully extracted outthe product list widget into a separatewidget of its own also I'll copy or cutall of these import lines and put itinside of the product list so now allthe errors from product list are alsogonebecause things like Global variables sothis thing over here requires Globalvariableswhere is it the products yupthen product card and product Detailspage everything is required and now if Irestart you won't see any visibledifferences on the app it will stillfeel the same way what has changedhowever is we have access to thisproduct list now changing fromone screen to another becomes easier howwell I'll show it to you what I'm goingto do is create a list of widget whichwill bepages and that will be equal to an emptylist withproduct list passed to it anda cart page so we have to go ahead andcreatecard underscore page dot dot importmaterial dot for itthen we are going to create a statelesswidget call it card page then we aregoing to return a scaffold a bodywith a centered text and we are going toname it cartpage so as of now this is what the cardpage looks like however we are going tofill that in we're going to create thatUI really soon so let's copy this cardpage and have it over here let's pasteit sweetso we are going to have const like thisperfect so we have a list of pages nowand that Pages includes product list andcart page so this is the page that wewant to showand how do we want to show it well if weare on zeroth page we want to show theproduct listif we are onfirst page I want to show the cart pageso we can have that if condition overhere right I can just have if currentpage is equal to 0then I'm going to have product listotherwise I'm going to havecart pageand that should work right so if we justrestart you see card page is showing upif I go to home page home page isshowing up and it does that correctlyhowever one small Improvement here couldbe if we just do Pages at current pagepause the video and give yourself a timeto understand what I've done if youdon't understand watch the next partso what I've done over here isI have Pages product list and card so ifcurrent page is zero then I'll accessthe product list which is Pages at zeroif current page is one then I'll accessPages at 1 which is cart pageso I'm basicallyperforming the same task but reallysmartlyif I add more pages further in the app Ican quickly change itso this is the thing I don't have to usethe ternary operator anymore and thisfeels better however one problem here isthat whenever I scroll and go to anotherpage then come back everything startsfrom scratch you know it just startsfrom everything I want that scrollposition to be maintained if I come overhere come back the scroll positionshould be maintained so for that we havea widget called index stack what indexstack does is it stores everything in astackand by Stack I mean it will just keep onpiling stuff so the state doesn't reallygo the state is still persisted inindexed stack so it requires childrenandthe children here are the pages so wecan just pass pages over herebecause children requires list of widgetand pages is a list of widgets so we canpass that inand now the next thing we want is indexso that it knows what page it is on andthe index for us is current page now ifyou do that restartcome back over herescroll and come back the scroll positionis maintained you see if I leave it atadded us like this come here come backadded our scroll position is stillmaintainedso index stack allows us to do thisand I hope you understood why Iextracted out the product list it wasjust so that we could toggle betweenthis part let me highlight it out thispart of the appandit will keep on changing based onwhether we select one bottom navigationbar item or another the next thing Iwant to do is make sure that the iconsover here are biggerso for that we can set some propertiesfor our bottom navigation barwhat we can do here is set an eigen sizeand the icon size here can be 35 save itand this looks bigger and I like itthe next thing over here is that thisapp bar is quite big or the bottomnavigation bar is quite big even onAndroid and that's there becausethe label occupies some space forexample if I pass in home the home isdisplayed over here you seeand the home is displayed that meanslabel is taking up the space even whenit's empty so what I want to do is makesure that the selected font size is 0and unselected font size is also zero ifboth of them are zero it will takelesser space you see and now it worksfine it works well and it looks good inmy opinion perfect now let's go aheadand design the cart page how do we wantthe cart page to look likeso let's close all the save file we'regoing to go to the left folder andcreateor we already have the card page createdwe'll just go there and start designingso in our scaffold the first thing thatis required is an app bar just sayingthat heywe are using the cart page so we'll havea title of app Carternow you'll notice inhome page that I have a scaffold bodyindex stack and in the body I have againmentioned a scaffold so there's ascaffold inside of a scaffold and thatworks fine as long as you don't have anapp bar now if you create an app barherelet's just create it for now if you havean app or over here it will look quiteweirdbecause you have one app bar and then asecond app bar so definitely you can puta scaffold inside of a scaffold but itcan look weird so anyways now we havethe given constraints in which we haveto put a scaffoldbut our constraint is very clear theentire screen except this part you knowthe bottom navigation bar so ourconstraint is this entire thing you canseeokayso we'll come over here and let's startdisplaying stuff so to display the stuffwe can just use a list view Builderdirectly nothing else just unless youbuild upbecause we don't have anything else tomentionand here we will also mention theitem count which will begot dot length and this cart is comingfrom Global variables here if you'vecopied stuff fromthe link mentioned in the descriptionbelowyou might have also copied this cardand this card contains just one itemwhich is the Jordan shoes all right nowyou can use that Also let's put contextindex inside of an item Buildernow if you're wondering and I didn'tanswer this before why is there acontext we understand why there is anindex why is there a context and contextis basically available in all Builderrelatedstuff for example if you add futureBuilder you could have a context thereif you just have a builder widget whichis a builder it's which is a widget ofitself you'll get a context there aswellso basically whenever you have Builderyou will have a context and if you'rewondering what the Builder widget doesI'm not talking about listview Builderthe Builder widget only it basicallyjust provides a context to youwhich you can useand it does have a significance of itsown it will provide you with the buildcontext that is not same as this contextnow in the item here what I want isfinal cart item which will be equal tocart at particular index now what do wereturn here well it's a very simplechoice I just want to return a tile thathas one heading one subheading an imageof thething we have in cart and a deletebutton if I want to remove it from thecard so for that particular reason whatI'm going to return from here is awidget that you've never seen before andthat is the list style widgetso usually whenever you have list viewBuilder list tile goes well because wellit has all the necessary properties youmight need to returnso it has a title that will help you todisplay a title stuff so let's have atext widget here this accepts a widgetand the text can be cart item at titledot to stringso we have a title that is goodthen it also has a subtitleand here also we can pass it a textwhich will betelling us the size so what number sizeshoe did the user select so let's saythe user selected a size of 8.remember this is just dummy datawhen we add State Management to the appwhich is the next step we will be ableto dive more into it so we can just havecart item at size that just looks goodnow if you come over here you'll seeJordan shoes size 8. perfectthe only problem I have is the title isnot bolded so let's go ahead and bold itout so I'm going to use style propertyhere but I'm not going to mention thenormal style I'll go to the main dot dotfile and I'm going to copy thisbody smalltitle that looks good to me so I'll justhave theme dot off context Dot texttheme dot body smallthen I'll save it and this is now boldedand it has the same size as 16. novisible difference thereafter this I want to add an image in thestart showing that this is the shoeyou've selected so I just want to showthat so for that we also have anotherwidget which is or another propertywhich is leading so what leading does isput whatever widget you have in thestartso you can use the leading widget hereand pass in a circle Avatarand then you pass in the backgroundimage which is a property to use onCircle Avatar what Circle Avatarbasically does is it gives you a roundedborder where you can describe yourbackground color background imageforeground image radius minimum radiusall of that stuffso here you can pass in a backgroundimage and this requires image providerwhat is our image well it's coming fromasset so you can pass in an asset imagehere you cannot pass in image dot assetbecause this is a widgetimage.asset is a widget however assetimage isn'ta widget asset image is a network oris a image providerif you see here asset image and go intothe definition of the source code you'llsee asset image extends asset buttonalimage provider and it extends an imageprovider so it's an image provider it'snot a widget image dot asset is a widgetsee here it requires image providers youcan pass an asset imageand if you're getting stuff from Networkor from web you can use Network imageso let's go ahead and use asset imageand pass in the asset my asset is cartitem will go to Global variables and wehave image URL so we'll pass in imageURL and we'll treat it as a stringperfectwe save it and we have our shoes showingupnow what if I want to increase the sizeof thisCircle that we have Circle Avatar hasproperties for that as well you can alsoset the radius property that will helpyou to change thesize of it so let's say the radius is 45so this is quite big and there you gobut I don't want it this big I want it30 let's saythat's fine and if you want to changethe background color over here you canchange it the yellow color is there justbecause of the theming we have set inthe overall app and the last thing Irequired here is a delete icon now thereare two things you can do away for thedelete icon either you can add a buttonover here that says hey you can removethis item from the card or you can havea swiping gesture saying if you swipethis you can delete the item in the cartor you just long press on it and you candelete it what I'm going to do is add anicon over here that says you can deletestuffthis is helpful becausethe user doesn't have to swipe throughor if the user doesn't know that theyhave to swipe to remove from the cartit's helpfulso now you can have a trailing widgethere which will be an icon buttonand on press is required so what shouldhappen if it is removed for now nothingand then icons dot deleteokaysave it you come over here and you havethe delete icon now the delete iconisn't in its original fashion in itsoriginal fashion it should be in the redcolor so let's get it red so we're goingto have a const icon icons dot deleteand we're also going to press or passthe color which is colors dot redand I'm not setting the theme away I'mgenerally typing colors.red because nomatter what the theme of our app is thedelete button has to be red colorand we have a delete button cool so wehave our cart layout set up as well nowthe next thing we need to add in our appis State Management so how do we managethe global state in our app we alreadydo that withset state so we are the local statemanagement but what should happen if Iclick on add to cartand it should show up in the card hereI've already explained all the stuffrelated to State Management andinherited widget which is what flutteruses behind the scenes to have StateManagement but we are going to take alook at an abstraction overinherited widget why because inheritedwidget can be a bit cumbersome to writeevery single time it is quite a bigsource code to write and yeah if youwant to know more about it link ismentioned in the description you shoulddefinitely check out the video by theflutter team themselvesso now let's dive into the StateManagement world and we are going tomanage a state using provider so forState Management we are going to takehelp of an external dependency and forthat I can go to pub.dev and the packagewe'll be using is providerthis provider package is a wrap aroundinherited Widget the widget that Iexplained to you but we did not writeand it is a wrapper around inheritedwidget to make them easier to use and itis more reusableby using provider instead of manuallywriting inherited widgetyou get all of these featuresall right and it's a good thingthere are other State Management optionsyou can use as well there's riverpodwhich is my personal favorite and youcan find that in the video I'llmentioned in the description below youcan check out my separate tutorial on itand after that I would recommend you tofollow with the project of Reddit cloneso that you get a proper practicalunderstanding of using riverpod in yourapps and another famous library thatpeople like to use is block and there'sanother package that people like to usein the flutter Community which is get Xbut I personally do not like it andit is the most liked package on pub.devso it's the most like package in flutterbut I personally do not like using itand you can find my video on why I don'tlike using it in the description as wellso we are not going to take a look atget at all and even blockbut riverpod you can find in the videodescription let's go ahead and useprovider now how should we use providerso the documentation or usage for it canbe found in theyeahbut I'm going to tell you how to use itbecause that's what the aim is right nowwe can copy this go to pubspect.amland add it to the dependenciesand then save it now I will get rid ofitand we'll start all our apps fromscratch now provider runs on everymachine so it can work on all theplatforms you can see it over here sothat's fine and at the end of the day itis just a wrapper around inheritedwidget which basically means like it isbuilt on inherited widget with a slightwrapper which allows you to use it veryeasily and it is a flood of favoritepackage so flutter recommends using thishowever the creator of this package isnot the Google teamit is the team or it is the person thatcreated the riverpod package as well andhe recommends using this packageover providerhowever we are going to use providerbecause that will give us a clearerinsight into inherited widgetRiver pod doesn't do that anyways let'sjust focus on provider and remove Revopod out of the picturenow here let's add provider so the firstthing to do in provider and I told youabout this in inherited widgetexplanation as well thathow inherited widget works is it createsa storehouse at the top of a widgetor at the top of the widget treeso we can do the same we can go to themain dot dot and we can wrap ourmaterial app with something known as aprovider widgetokay this provide a widget is comingfrom the provider package and it extendsinherited provider in edited providerextends single child stateless widgetthis extends a stateless widget so thisis a widgetthat you can useand the task of this provider is tostore this dataand you store this data using the createoption wire send create you pass anyvalue it accepts Dynamic value which isbasically like hey you can pass anythingyou want it can be your own custom classyou get can be a string so let's goahead and return a string from here withjust saves hello world all right I'mjust showing you how to use provider inyour apps so you can buildor provide value from one place toanotherso what you've done is at the top of thewidget tree you said hey we have aprovider and the descending widgets canuse this valueso whatever value we're returning thedescending widgets can use it and if youhover over this it is automaticallygetting a type of Provider string sowhatever value you type over here willbe the type of this providercool now we can go to the cart pagelet's saynow the thing we have to concentrate onis how do I get this value how do I getthe value hello world in my cart pagewell you can do that by printingproviderdot of contextand herewe have to mention a generic type nowyou already know provider.off contextsyntax right it is the inherited widgetsyntaxexactlybut this also requires a generic type ifyou mention a generic type it will beable to find the provider so if we havestring here and then let's just say weprintedyou see hello world is written if Irestart the app hello world is writtenhow does this work how are we gettingthe value in my app in the cart Page bynot even giving arguments and that isthe beauty of provider and inheritedwidgetwe mentioned hello world over here sothis was a provider of type string thenwe called provider dot off context so itwent up the widget tree trying to findthe nearest ancestorto provide a DOT off stringso itsearched the type of Provider string allright it went up the widget tree andtried to find a provider which was likethis provider string and then when itfinally foundedit returned the valuenow what if I have two providers insteadof oneso I have one provider at the root ofthe widget tree and let's say I haveanotherwhich is wrapping the home page allright I have a provider here which wrapsthe home page and let's say we say helloalso this requires a function so let'spass in a function all rightcoolnow if we restart we see Hello writtenover here hello world is gone now onlyHello is returned and that's becauseprovider dot off context is trying tofind the nearest widget to itor the nearest widget in the widget treeand the nearest widget is this part overherethat's why we get hello we don't gethello and hello world both because onceit finds the particular provider it willstop looking for any more providers it'sdone so it doesn't look any furtherit will give the value given by thishello perfectso now that we have used providerI want to tell you that there aremultiple types of providers there areproviders like provider we've alreadyseen this then we have changed Notifierproviderthen we have a future provider and thenwe have a stream provider so these arethe four main types of providers thatyou can use in your appprovider we have already seen is aread-only value so you can just provideone value and it will only read it willdo nothing else then there's changenodifier provider with this provider youcan change the valuesand notify the widgets that arelistening to it about those changesthis is the provider we want in ourshopping app then we have futureprovider so future provider is there sothat it can listen to Futures subscribeto them and show the changesand stream provider is basicallyproviding a streamfuture and stream providers are usefulbecause provider helps in lazy loadingrightso it can help over there and that is agood thing however we'll be onlyfocusing on change nodifier Providerfrom now so instead of returning aprovider which is a read-only value wedon't need that anymore we're going toreturn a change nodifier providerbut if I just do change Notifierproviderit's not enoughwe need to provide a generic type oferror and a generic type as let's saystring but string doesn't conform to theboundary of change node file basicallywhenever you have change Notifierproviderand you have a create function youcannot pass in a string or anything youneed to pass in something known as achange node file okay and what is thischange Notifier it is a simple class inthe flutter SDK which we can use so it'scoming from flutter not from providerand what this does is provides changenotification to whatever is listening toit soif any updates are made or anything isdone it will notify the widgetslistening to it and will rebuild thosechangesbut now we cannot just use changeNotifier like this we have to use it alittle bit differently what we need todo is create our own separate class solet's callour provider as cart provider.dot thenwe are going to have class card providerI always like tohave anything related to provider usingcart providerso it's clear for me to knowif it's a provider or not then we haveto extend this with change node F5 allright as soon as you extend changeNotifier you can take this class andreturn it over here so you can returncard provider over here nowthis card provider is accessiblethroughout your entire app so whateveryou define over here can be used outsideof this classin the home page in the cart pageanywhere in your app and that's a plusright so this just tells us that if Iclick on add to cart and I store it incart provider then I'll be able to seeit in the card screen if I use the samecard provider and that's exactly what weare going to dothis card provider is a storehouse rightat the top so here I'm going to create avariable call thisfinalmap string comma Dynamic cart and thatis equal to an empty listbut here a value of type less Dynamiccannot be assigned to a variable of typemap string dynamicit's basically saying that heyyour card is a map of string commaDynamic how are you assigning to this toa list and that's true my card cannot bejust a map if it's just a map I'll beable to store one single product I wantto store multiple products so I need tohave a listokay now that I have a list I can createtwo functions add productand remove product so I'm going to haveremove productso two functions are present in cartprovider which we can use so in addproduct we are going to get one productwhich we need to add to our cart so Ican have map string comma Dynamicproductthen I'm going to do cart dot addproduct simplenow the same thing is going to happen inthe remove product as well I'm going toget a product here and then I'm going todo cart dot remove productso this way my card provider is up andready as simple as thatsince the instance of this class isaccessible throughout our entire app Ican go to one particular page and whereI want to go to is product Details pageI hope you understood what happened incard provider I created a class extendedit using change Notifier so that I coulduse it in main.dot in the card providerover hereand then what I did is ADD product addedit to the cart list remove product thoseare just functions and now whenever thisadd to cart button is clicked onI'm going tocall this particular functionokay so let's go ahead and do it so I'mgoing to go to the product Details pagethen I'm going to go to the elevatedbutton on pressed and here I'm going tohave providerdot of context and here I need tomention the type what is the type of myprovider now if you want to take a lookat it you can come over hereand the type of provider is cartprovider you can use that so you'll haveprovider.off cartproviderDot and you have the option to add aproductnow I'm just going to click on ADDproductand then I will mention my map what ismy mapwell it's this thing product but you seeI can't access product over here and Ican't access it because I'm in astateful widget whenever I'm in astateful widget I am unable to accessthis product then how did we do itearlierwidget.parada but we didn't write widgetdot product rightflutter did it for ourselves so when weadd stateless to stateful widgetconversion we wrote widget itautomatically converted product towidget dot product because we are in aseparate class of ourselves righthow do we access element of this classwe cannot do thatthat's why state has created a widgetproperty or a widget getter for us whichwe can use to access Constructorarguments or whatever we want to do andthat's how we get access to widget dotproductso I can add the product like thisand now just to see if it is workingI'll press command JI'll restart my entire app and I'mgetting an errorI am getting an error saying thefollowing provider not found exceptionwas thrown building card page so theerror is in card page and the error hereis that provider.off string context wascalled and there's no provider whichReturns the string for us in the entirewidget tree we had it but we removed itand replaced it with cart provider sothis no longer exists that's why we getprovider not found exception so when aprovider doesn't exist in your directwidget treethat's when you get provider not foundexceptionso let's remove or not remove Providerfrom here we are going to print providerdot of contextcartproviderDot card so we're going to print thisthing out and now I'm going to restartmy app I see an empty list I come overhere I click on add to cart and I get anarrowthe error says that I tried to listen toa value exposed with Provider fromoutside of the widget treenow this error basically occurredand you can see the reason below this islikely caused by an event handler like abuttons on press that called providerdot off without passing listen falsebasically whenever you useprovider dot offcontext you always have to listen tostuff you're just saying that hey I'msubscribed to cart provider now anychanges made to cart providers any ofthe services I want to subscribe to themI want to listen to all of those changesthat's what change Notifier also doeswhen you extend to a change Notifier itwill notify all the widgets that arelistening to it about its state changehere what happened is you're sayingprovider.off card provider context soyou're basically saying that hey I wantto listen to card provider but thenyou're calling add product function onit so you're not really listening you'rejustcalling a function so whenever you'recalling a functionbeside the context you also need toprovide one thing which is listen andset it to false by default listen is setto true in our cart page the listen isset to true all rightbut here you're saying listen is falseand then add product and listen shouldbe falseevery time you use this function out ofthe buildfunction all right whenever you useprovider dot off card provider contextout of the build functionlisten should be set to false and ifyou're in on pressed it is basically outof the build function because you cantake this on pressed and put it likethis voidon taplike this right so you're now out of thebuild function and then you can pass onTabso now you're out of the build functionand it still works fine now you mightraise a question hey how are we usingbuild context when we are out of thebuild function build context is thereonly over here how can you use it overhere I can use it over here thanks tothe state class that we are extendingthis date class also gives us access tothe build context and this build contextthat the state provides and this buildcontext is the exact same thing it isthe exact same element so you can use itwherever you wantbut yeah in a stateless Widget thecontext is not given becausethis context is given by the state classit is not given by state full widgetso stateless widget cannot give thatonly state can and obviously in astateless widget we do not extend stategreatso now that we are in afunction outside of the build functionwe are using listen false and anytimeyou want to call a function from cardprovider you have to set listen to falseif you said listen to true you'rebasically saying that heyI'min the widget tree I want tocontinuously listen to the changes andthat's definitely not the case over hereanyways now that we have understood thiswe'll restart the app we'll come overhere we'll add to cart let's open theterminal nothing shows upand there's still an empty listif I add to cart again still nothingworksif I go back come here let's say add tocartstill nothing worksso why is this not workingwell this is not working becausewhenever you usechange Notifier or extend changeNotifierit doesn't do anything automaticallyit only notifies thewidgets listening to it when you call aparticular function which is notifylisteners and this function is given bychange Notifier itselfso you extend change Notifier and yousee it is a mixing class so you can alsodo card provider with change notify orextends to notify same thing and as soonas you do notify listeners and restartyour entire app come to men's Nike shoesadd to cartcommand J and now you see automaticallyyou have access tothe changes made over here and this datais coming from the card page so youupdate it one place and the data isstored in some other place that's thecool thing rightnow in the card provider we are going todo the same thing for notify listenersof a remove product so when you remove aproduct you can have notify listenerslike thisso notify listeners just notifies allthe things that are listening to thiscard provider sweet now the problem Ihave right now is I cannot display thedata that is coming from this cartthat's because sizes is giving me a listand it's just giving me a productwhat I wantis something like this I want ID titleprice image URL company all written overhere but I also want sizesince I want size over here I'll have tomodify this widget dot product a littlebitso how are we going to do thiswell we can have something like thisso what I'm going to do is copy thisthis is the layout in which I want myproductor my cart product then I can have itlike this then I mentioned the ID so theID is widget dot product at ID and thesame thing for literally every singlething we have widget dot product titlewidget dot productthen we have price then we have widgetdot product image URLand do that for everything all rightso you have image URL here and finallywidget productfor the companysweet and the size here is going to bethe selected sizealso you can add an if condition overhere what if the user does not select asizewhat do we want to do in that case wellfirst of all I don't want to update mycartotherwise it will come like selectedsize is 0. and that's a wrong thingbecause a shoe cannot have a size ofzero so I'll just have if selected sizeis equal to 0thenI want to do something elseso I'll just have a reverse condition ifselected size is not equal to 0then I'm just going to paste it overhereso if selected size is not zero it issomething elseand that has to be from some selectedsize we have decidedthen we can go aheadso now we restartcome over here let's say I add to cartnothing gets added to the cart and thisis kind of like a bad user feedback youcan say because what's happening here isyou add to cart the user doesn't reallyknow that they have to select a sizemaybe they forgot to do thatso you have to tell the users that heyyou need to select a sizeso here in the else condition you cantell the users that and here I want tobasically showa thing popping up from below sayingthat hey you need toselect a sizeso for that we have something known asscaffold messengernot scaffoldscaffoldmessenger dot off context againthis is using inherited widget behindthe scenes and I'll explain why Dotand this has multiple things like showmaterial Banner remove current snack barall of that what we want is show snackbar and this requires something known assnack bar so let's pass it in then snackbar requires content so let's pass thecontent which will be a text becausecontent requires a widget and then yousayplease select a sizeokay and then we are going to put a consfor the snack bar and once we come overhere let's go back come over hereadd to cart you see please select a sizeso this is our scaffold messengershowing up why does this use a narratedwidget because it wants to show thesnack bar on one particular screen andhere it is just contacting the messengerof a scaffold all right earlier this wasknown as scaffold.off context but thenit caused some problems with buildcontextand cause problems like build contextnot found that's why this was renamed toscaffold messengerso what happens is it's it Finds Itsnearest scaffoldnow it Finds Its nearest scaffoldmessenger and shows a snack bar on thatparticular scaffold and what is thesnack bar snack bar is a thing thatshows up from the below giving usan impression that hey you need to dosomethingokayso now if I select a size add to cartit will be added to cart but I stillhave no clue that it was added to mycart so what I can add here is again ascaffold messenger and a snack barsayingproductadded successfullysave itthen you again select some other productlet's say this then you have productadded successfully you go back come overhereand you won't be able to see the changesbecause our card does not depend on itbut the changes are reflected over herenow let's go ahead and make the changesover here in our cart pagenow whenever you want to continuouslylisten to something in relation to aprovider we have to do that in the buildcontext otherwise lesson will be set tofalse and we won't be able to listen toanythingso let's save our final card is thisthing over herethen we'll remove Global variables andas thing is doneso the item count is card dot lengthcart item is cart at indexand now it's safe to say that we canremove cart from our appthe dummy data still needs to be therenow we can close all the save files weare going to restart our appall the data is now gone becausethe provider doesn't store datapermanently in our storage it onlystores it temporarily as long as the appis running after you restart or resetthe app it is all goneso let's go ahead and select 11 sizethen we'll go to Adidas shoes We'll adda 10 sizethen we'll add a Jordan shoes and addeight size then we come to the cart andwe see three things men's Nike shoessize 11 10 8 and all the proper imagesare showing up perfectthe last thing I want to work on is thisdelete productso whenever I delete something from yourit should remove it from my cartbut even before doing that I want aconfirmation I want my app to ask themare you sure you want to remove thisproduct if you're sure only then we'llremove it for youwe already have the remove productfunction ready all we need to do isput up a dialog box what we want iswhenever we click on this particularbutton it should show up a dialog boxright in the center saying delete chooseor delete from to delete product are yousure you want to remove products fromcart and then you have two options noyes so this is what you want to do let'sgo ahead and do that really quicklyso in card pageWhenever there is on pressed you canhave something known as show dialogthis show dialog is a function given byflutter that will allow you to displayUI it will allow you to show a dialogueon the screenand then it has a builder so you get acontext and you can use that context todisplay stuff now this Builder requiresyou to return a widget from thisfunction of build context that it'sgivingnow what do we want to return well Ijust want to return a dialogue let's sayif I have a dialogwill that work well let's go ahead andtry it out you see when I click overhere the screen does get blurredthat's because of our dialogue now I'llpass a child here and the child is let'ssay text and we say are you surethen become aware we select we see adialogue saying are you sureso you can set it up for yourself youknow you can design dialogues on yourown I have that much faith in you at theend of the day we are returning a widgetso you can use container padding columnall of your creativity to return aparticular dialogue but if you don'twant to do all of this there is abuilt-in widget called alert dialogwhich you can use and I like to use itfor this kind of stuffthis basically tells you to show analert dialogue that hey you're doingsomethingthat is a bit risky not exactly risky inthis case you're just removing a productfrom your cart but it just verifies thathey you're doing thisso let's go ahead and set it up itrequires a title which is exactly whatwe want so we are going to havedelete product as the titlenow when we click over here deleteproduct is the titleand you see that this is quite big Idon't want it this big and the reasonit's big is because the title hasa style it isinheriting fromwe can override that by having themedot off context Dottext themeDotlet's say body medium save itthis doesn't look very good so I'm goingto go with something large which istitle large let's say now if I clickover here this is quite bigmaybe we want title mediumand this looks good enoughso we have delete product as the maintitle after that we need something likea subtitleand there's nothing like a subtitle butwe do have contentso what is our content well very simplyit is a text saying are you sure youwant to removethe productfrom your cartokaythis is my content this is my textwidgetjust asking it are you sure you want todo thisbecause this is an alert dialogue itjust asks for your confirmation now if Iclick over here we see this this islooking goodthe last thing I want here is a no and ayes button so that the users can selectaccordinglyand for that we have something given byalert dialog which is actions actions isthe same thing that is available on theapp bar as well which you can use to addaction related stuffthings that you want to mention overhereand the same thing is here as well ifyou want to mention something so I wanttwo things over heretwo text buttons basically the firstvertex button is going to be a textsayingnoalso this will be a constant text no andthen there's going to be another textbutton which is going to be yes allrightnow if we click over herewe don't see the buttons but they arethere no and yes now we just have tochange their designso for this we'll have to set up thestyle and everything so let's go aheadandpass the style astext button or actually we don't need todo this we can just mention the styleover here for the text textile now whatis the color of no going to be well Ijust want it to becolors.blue because no is a safer optionand the other option Also let's putfontway dot boldier and the other optionwhich I'm going to copy paste is yesand that is going to be colors.rednow if you click over here yes is thereno is there you can select either ofthemyou can set more properties on this showdialog basically like if you want todisallow the user from clicking outsideright now if I click outside of thedialog I can still exit but if you wantto make sure the users can avoid thatyou can set barrier dismissable to falseonce you do that the users won't beallowed to click outsideand exited like this I can't exert iteven though I'm clickingbut anyways I like this better so I'mgoing to keep itand now I can't exit it so I'm justgoing to restart my appthen add some shoescome over here and we have men's Nikeshoes size 11 and size 12 properly therenow in the know what I want to do iswhenever the user clicks on no I justwant this dialog to go away and donothing just this dialogue should goawayso to make this dialog go away I can useNavigator dot off context dot poponce I do thisand click on no it just removes thedialogue nothing else because what thisdialog does is itStacks it it Stacks it at the top of thescreen so navigator.off context dot popwill just remove itafter this we have yes in yes what do wehave to do well I just want to callprovider dot off context then again Ihave to access cart providerthen lesson should be set to false don'tforget that dot remove productand what is the product I want to removethe product is mentioned over here it isthe cart item so you can just mentionthe cart item and donenow if you want to remove Adidas shoesyou can click on yes and Adidas shoesgets removed but the dialogue isn'tpopped offwe still have to call navigator.offcontext dot pop to remove this thingso let's click on no now we have deletebutton yes and will clear off the cardfor us now we can go ahead and setthings up let's say 109and now if I come over here yeah size 10size 9 and I can remove anything I wantand it works fineso this was what I wanted to talk aboutState Management with providerprovider has its flaws for surebut this is very close to inheritedwidget which is why I wanted to takethis up now there are some things youcan modify here first of all this is abig line to rideisn't it so what you can do is finalcard is equal to context dot watchas soon as you do context.watch providergets triggered then you have to use thecart providerand there you goyou now have an instance of cartprovider with you now you just have tocall the cart and it will work just asintendedso we have context.watch here instead ofprovider.off card provider context Dotcard so this is a shorthand Syntax forthe same thingit will work just as expected you cantry it for yourselfand here whenever we havea function called what we need to do iscontext dot readyou can't use context.watch becauselesson Falls means read it isn't watchwatch is basically like yourcontinuously seeing read is you justread it once and leave itso again you need to mention cardprovider over here and then you can havedot remove product and pass in theparticular card eitherand you can make these changeseverywhere in your appit is just a shorthand Syntax for it itisa function which basically does providea DOT off context this lesson Fallsand I think this is an extension yeahthis is an extension on build contextprovided by flutterso yeah you can you do this to simplifyyour lifeand that works great looks great perfectnow you can make these changes allaround your app and this is how it isdone so yeah we are done with StateManagement with provider in our shoppingappone last thing I'd like to mentionbefore closing the State Managementchapter with provider if you want toreturn multiple providers in a biggerapplication what you can do and I'mgoing to remove this comment is returnmulti-provider with multi-provider youcan return a list of providers and thereyou can mention your change Notifierprovider where you pass in a context andreturn card provideras simple as that so if you havemultiple providers you can pass it inmulti-provider otherwise change Notifierprovider or just provider is fine butmost of the times in bigger apps youwill be using multi-provider onlybecause you will have multiple providersthere's a lot less boilerplate code towrite when using provider as it is awrapper around inherited widget a widgetprovided by flutter itself to pass databetween other widgets using provider wecan separate business logic from UImaking our code much easier to test andmaintain in this tutorial we will gothrough different type of providers andunderstand when to use what type ofProvider first one is provider itself asthe name suggests provider provides datato visits below it in the widget tree todemonstrate this I'll wrap the root ofmy widget tree with provider this actslike a storehouse for datawait a minute which data whatever wepass in the create argument it can bestring Boolean and even instance of aclassto read this data in a widget we can useprovider dot off then the type of thedata we return followed by contextwhat happens behind the scenes is itgoes up the widget Tree finds theprovider widget closest with the type wereturn and spits out the data that'sstored we can see the data correctlywhen we display it on the screen as wellif you find the syntax really long youcan use context.watch followed by thetype of provider and it will work thesame way provider is a read-only widgetwhich means it cannot modify the valueinitially passed to it so how do wemodify the values with the help ofchange nodifier provider instead ofProvider we will pass in chain Notifierprovider and in the create argument passin a data modelto create a data model we will create aClass instantiate A Private variablecreate a getter and a function thatincrements the variable's value by 1. tomake this work properly with changenodifier provider extend the class withchain Notifier which provides us withnotify listeners function whenever thisfunction is called it notifies chainNotifier provider and widgets listeningto it are rebuiltif you don't use notify listeners the UIof the app won't get affected eventhough the data in our case countervariables value changesalso note that more functions likedecrement and reset can be added in themodel class itself getting data is samefor all providers we just need tospecify the type of Provider properlysince we have counter return in chainnodifier provider we will replace stringwith counter but as you can see thisreturns instance of the counter class sowe will use counter getter we created inthis class to see the countnow to implement the increment functionwe can use this line why let's break itdown provider dot off counter contextwill return to us the instance of thecounter class on this instance we arecalling increment function inside ofwhich we call notify listeners and thiswill rebuild this widget since we arelistening to it but what if I don't wantto listen meaning I don't want thewidget to rebuild so I can set listen tofalse for a shorter syntax we can usecontext dot read it's worth noting thatcontext.read cannot be called insidebuild function on the other handcontext.watch cannot be called outsideof build function another thing to noteis context.watch should generally beused when every part of the widget needsthat value because it makes the entirewidget rebuilt for example when I clickon the increment button only the counterneeds to rebuild but in reality even thetext and floating action button rebuildthis might not seem like a bigdifference but what if you're buildingTwitter like app and to update thenumber of likes you're rebuilding thewhole postcard to prevent thisunnecessary widget rebuild wrap thecounter text with consumer widget whichwill make only the widget returning fromit rebuild give consumer the return datatype and to get the data we can useinstance of return data type provided tous don't forget to remove yourcontext.watch calls otherwise it willstill rebuild the entire widget nexttype of provider is stream Provider fromthe name itself we know that it willhelp us manage stream data it is likestream Builder but with lesserboilerplate instead of chain Notifierwrap my app with stream provider in thecreate argument pass in a stream likethis in our case it will output 0 to 9with a gap of 1 second after each numberinitial data argument is also requiredit is the data to be displayed until theabove stream gives us a value to readthis go down to the consumer replacecounter within which is the data type weare returning from stream provider andremove dot counter it works prop if yourestart the appequivalent of consumer in this case willbe the followingfuture provider is similar to streamprovider it too accepts initial data andcreate arguments and works the same wayso I'm not going to rewrite the wholething but basic difference is futureprovider returns a value after thefuture is completed now we know aboutmost of the essential providers but herecomes a problem what if I want to useboth stream provider and change Notifierprovided together in the application wecan do something like this right wrap myapp with provider pass data in createand in the child change Notifierprovider likewise we can do for hundredsof providers in a vast app rightno why use this nesting hell well only asingle provider can help us which ismulti-provider it accepts list ofproviders in the argument and that's itthat's how easy it is to add multipleproviders in our application now thelast provider we're going to look at isproxy provider when one of our providerdepends on value returned from anotherprovider we use proxy provider todemonstrate this I'll create anotherclass in a code called second class andaccept instance of Firebase odds fromConstructor here we can create anymethod that we want I'll just keep itempty now I want to provide this classso I'll go into the multi provider whereFirebase auth is already provided toaccess this Firebase auth instance Iwill use proxy provider the syntax islike this proxy provider and unlikeother providers we pass two typesindependent class and the dependentclass then we need to pass updateargument which gives us context followedby instance of the independent anddependent classes we will return theclass from this function passing auth asthe argument this will make a providerwork but what if the class doesn't needone but two three even four instances wewill use proxy provider 2 3 4 and so onfor it and that's pretty much it thenext thing I want to do is focus onresponsive UI by responsive UI I meanthe device or our app should look goodon all screen sizes and that includesChromeMac OS Apple Android all of them itshould look good on all the screen sizesso right now our app looks good on IOSand Android and that's cool but now I'mgoing to switch to Chrome and I'm goingto run it on Chrome to see how it lookson a bigger screen size all right solet's launch itand while that is happening I also wantto restructure the folder structure nowyou see there are many components in ourlib folder so obviously we need tosegregate things we need to put all thepages in one particular page we want toput providers in one providerand we need to do all of those tasks solet's go ahead and do it in the lab weare going to go ahead and create a Pagesfolder then I'm going to take cart pagedrag it in pagesthen I'll may let extension dot make thechanges and save those changesthen I'll put home page as wellthen we are done with that let's save itafter that we need another folder and weare going to name it widgets this isgoing to contain small widgets notexactly pages but smaller widgets sowe'll pass in the product card let'smove it inand let's save the changes and one thingI forgot to do was put product Detailspage in pages so let's put it theresave it and then the last thing is Ithink provide a product list and productlist also goes in the pagesso we have widgets and pages so this isgood for a smaller application then inthe lip folder I'm also going to createproviders and as our app skills we aregoing to have more providers rightso we are going to create a separateproviders where all the providers aregoing to stay like cart provider alsosave those changes if you don't save itit will give error in your app so wehave Pages provider widgets and Globalvariables can stay hereor you can create a utils folder andsave it in utility but I don't like todo that utility includes some otherthings not exactly Global variablesGlobal variables can be constantsor something else all right so we have acleaner folder structure herethe purpose of a clean folder structureis that you canjust have your apps layout very nicelyand more Engineers working on it will bea better thing all right and even theChrome is now set up so if you come overhere and expand the app there is Chromeand this looks decent enough not bad notgoodif we come to the product list over herewe are getting an error and this erroris there because it wasn't able to findsomething we just need to restartbecause this happened when we werechanging the folders right now if youcome over here the error is gone perfectso what are the changes we need to makewell the first change as you can see inthe details men's Nike shoesthis shoe image is quite big I want toreduce the shoe image size and that'snot just for one shoe even this shoe isquite bigso let's go to the product Details pageand scroll down we'll find ourimage.asset and as you can see thiserror is there because we haven't set aparticular height for it and what shouldthe height be well let's go ahead andsee it the height should be 250 let'ssay if we do that come over herethis shows up nicely and if we go to theiOS deviceover here and we click on it we have 250showing up this looks cool it works onboth the screen sizeslet's click over here and yeah thislooks cool I'm fine with it also if youright click on Chromeclick on inspect you'll be clicking onthis icon over here to toggle devicetoolbar and now you can check for theresponsive design from here itself rightand as you can see when we increase thefont size the maximum height it takes iswhat we've mentioned over here 250 andwhen we shrink the size the image heightkeeps on decreasing so that's a goodthing for us righteven for our button if you see that'sthe case the button keeps on increasingand it takes the entire width of thescreenwith the padding there now I don't wantthis what I want is the button to onlybe thereonly this muchjust like ourshoe all right so it shouldn't be thisbig because it looks kind of weirddoesn't it so we can scroll down to ourbutton and here you see we have set upthe minimum size how this works is itthe minimum size it can take is doubledot infinity and then we've wrapped itwith paddingso they're spacing over herehowever what we can see here is maximumsize can be this muchthen when we clickyou see this is quite small because themaximum size it can take is this so wehave set up a constraint over here thatmaximum size is this much minimum sizecan be whatever youhave the child as how much ever size thechild requires and same happens overhere although I'm pleased with theresult this is not what we want so weare going to use fixed size over herebecause maximum size gives usa very small result minimum size givesus a very big resultfixed size will give us exactly what wewant so instead of passing in double dotInfinity I'll pass 250this is good enough and if I pass 350Come Awayyou see this looks good enoughthe problem then comes on the pixelemulator all right if we just open itand take a look if it looks good enoughlet's run it without debugging if itworks well on the pixel emulator thenwe're fine with that it all looks goodbut if it doesn't then something needsto changeand we have the pixel emulatorif I click on a product add to cart isthere and it's similar to this thingover here perfect I like it this way sothis works well on thescreens on all the screens in fact so weare done with the product detail screenthe selecting part is still the same wecan add to cart we can go back come tothe shopping cart and we'll see ourproductand here if I click on delete deleteproduct everything looks good it's allgood in my opinion you know the dialoguetakes only this much space which is whatI wantthenthis is the size that I want I onlywanted this much so everything looksgood over here but the problem I haveright now is this card over here thiscard takes in a lot of width and thiswidth is fine over here this width iscompletely perfect but over here it'staking in a lot of width what I want todo instead is if we exceed a certainscreen size or screen width let'sinspect the tab and come over here so ifI reach let's say this much heightlet's say this much heightthen Iautomatically want to show double cardsso I want two cards to be displaying onthe single screenand when we are less than thatparticular dimensionI want only one card to display so itdepends on what the screen size isagain just to tell you if I expand thisI want two cards but when I have itminimized like it's in a phone mode Iwant it this long I only want one cardto be present otherwise two cards so howcan I make this happen that's where wehave another widget in place frada givesit to us what is thatif we just come to the home page and inthe home page we have to go to theproduct listin the list view Buildernow this listview Builder this list viewBuilder is for filters and filters lookgreatthis is the thing I'm worried about thislist view Builder over herenow instead of returning one list overhereI'm going to have grids and it dependson the screen size rightso how do I calculate the device widthso for that particular reason we havefinalsize which is equal to Media querythis media query gives us a lot ofthings it will give us what platform weare on what is our screen height what isour screen size what is our screen widthwhat mode are we on so like if the phoneis in a straight mode or if it is in ahorizontal mode like this it will giveus all of that dataso it's pretty helpful for us yes youcan click over here to change the modeof the app or mode of the phoneif it's portrait mode or horizontal modewhateverso media query gives us access to all ofthat so what I want is mediaquery dotoff context dot size you can see overhere it gives us a lot many more thingslike view padding View and such platformbrightness and you can look at all thethings it gives us but what I want issize why because size will give me theperfect size and then it will give methe size of the media and logical pixelsexample the size of the screen that'swhat I wantand also you'll see away a media querydot off context and if you see over herefor the media query itself it extendssomething known as inherited model notinherited widget a narrated model iskind of like inherited widget butthere is a slight difference we aregoing to talk aboutlet me justtell you how this works how we can maketwo cards appear on a bigger screen andonly one card on a smaller screen andthen we can talk about the differencebetween inherited model and inheritedwidgetand how it affects usso we'll scroll down and here where ourlist view Builder is there expanded isthere in the childso first of all let me make it clearthat whenever we want to display twoitemsinkind of like a grid what we use is gridview Builder so just like listviewBuilder there's grid view Builder andobviously there is grid view as wellwhich you can usebut great view Builder is used when youdon't know the number of items the gridis going to have in our case productsdot length is the number of items inGrid View and list view both as of rightnow we know what the products length isbut if we make database connections andwe dynamically get it from the databasewe won't know how many products arethere just think of Amazon does Amazonknow how many products there are theyare like billion products they can'tpossibly know how many exact items orproducts are therethat's why there is item Builder andgrid view Builder widgetsso we are going to use grid view Builderand just to give you a demonstration I'mgoing to comment this out I'm only goingto have expanded again because this bais similar to listview Builder it willtake in theentire height of the screen but itdoesn't have the entire heightso we have to wrap it with expanded thenwe are going to have grid view Builderthis requires grid delegate and then itrequires sliver grid delegate this griddelegate controls the layout of thechildren so this will tell it how manyitems we want in a row how manyitems should have how much spacing soall of that configurations can be madewith sliver grid delegate so let's typeit out sliver grid delegate but then itis an abstract class abstract classesare made so that we can use theirsubtypes which follows a particularattribute for example get layout andshould relay relay outshould be followed by every class thatextends or implements sliver griddelegate that's why abstract classes aremade and your abstract classes areallowedhere I can pass in anything sliver griddelegate related for example sliver griddelegate with fixed cross access countsliver grid delegate with fixed with Maxcross access counts level Grid delegatewith fixed cross access so all of thatis present aware what we want is slivergrid delegate with fixed cross accesscounthere we get an error but this error isnot because this is an abstract classthis isn'tthis is a normal class but requires anamed argument but before jumping intothat let's format it and understand whatthis means sliver grid delegate withfixed cross access count we know whatsliver grid delegate is it's this thingthat it requires to control the layoutof our childrenin the grid view Builder obviouslywith fixed cross access count basicallymeans how many items you want in one rowin the product list or in the grid viewBuilderand how many do we want to display inone particular row I want to displaylet's say two widgets at the mostso here we have to pass in a requiredargument of cross access count whichwill be 2.now consider grid view as a column rightall the widgets are going to be onebelow another so consider it a column bypassing in Cross access you're basicallymentioning everything in a row formatthat's what column does right when youpass in Cross access alignment you passin the alignment in horizontal Directionthat's what we are doing here so let'sput Constable error then we are going tohave context index just like we had withlist Viewand then we want the exact same thingthat we had over here so let's go aheadand uncomment thiswe can copy this gesture detector andreturn it over herethen again we can comment the list viewBuilder I only uncommented because Iwanted to copy stuff now it requiresproductwhat is the product well first of all wehave to mention the item count even gridview Builder has the same thing itemcount so let's go ahead pass in productsdot length and product is going to befinal productis equal toproducts at indexgreat all the errors are now gone thewarning is up there over here and it'sthere because of the size variable thatwe've never used we're going to use itin just a moment after we understand howgrid view Builder works now let'srestart become aware and we see twoproducts displaying in a grid formatperfectnow if you come over herewe have the same thing displaying butthis error here is Justified because itjust looks so awful on a mobile screenhowever this looks cool enough over hereright two products and this looks betterhowever we have a problem over here weare going to fix that problem but firstof all we just want to configure thelayout such that on smaller screen sizeswe use a list view Builder otherwise agrid view Builderso it's very simple we just want to getthe device sizeand that device size should not exceed600 or 650 which is what the normaldevicessize isand then accordingly we can display agrid view Builder so basicallywe want to check if the device width isgreater than 650 if it is greater than 6with 50 that means we want a grid viewBuilder because it's a bigger screensize however if we are less than 650screen width then we want to display alist view Builder because it's a smallerscreen size so we can take the sizethenwe can uncomment this lineand then have our if condition laid outwhat is the rift conditionit's a ternary operator we are justgoing to have size dot width so withsize dot width I get access to thedevice width this is not the width ofany widget or any constraintsit doesn't follow any constraints ofpadding or whatever it just gives us theentire device width so here I'm justchecking if size dot width is greaterthan650 then I want list view Builder orgrid view Builder sorry so I'll copygrid view Buildercut it also remove expanded from herebecause expanded is already there at thetop and then we are going to have gridview Builder like thisotherwise we are going to display a listview Builderso if size dot width is greater than 650we show a grid view Builder otherwise alist view Builder works so a grid viewBuilder is still shown here however alist view Builder is shown here that'sperfect exactly what I wantedso this is where media query can help usmedia query can also help us to size thewidgetsaccording to what we want if we wantthis widget size to be bigger it can bebigger if we want it to be smaller itcan be smallernow let's come over here and try to fixthisdevice height why are we getting such abig device height over hereso why is this thing over here exceedingto understand that we must first analyzeon a smaller screen on a smaller screenthis looks good it's perfect exactly theway I wanted it so there's definitely noissue in the product card otherwise youmight think hey product card is takingtoo much height no we have notexplicitly set any height for ourproduct card for our container andthat's how it should befirst you should never mention theheightyou should always try to use flexibleexpanded all of those widgets wheneveryou're using you shouldn't specificallygo ahead and type hey I want to use thisheight when things become uncontrollableby expanded double dot Infinity all ofthose stuff then you need to explicitlymention a height just like we did withthe add to cart buttonI'll summarize this at the end but as ofright now no we are not going tochange the height in the product cardbecause it's all good it is taking asmuch height as it should on a list viewBuilder but it's not doing the same ongrid view Builder so there's a problemwith grid view Builder and what is theproblemyou can Google it but if I have to tellyou the problem is this child aspectratio over here the child aspect ratiois the ratio ofmay cross axis extend to main accessextent and that is one meaning crossaccess extent is this big then mainaccess extent should also be this bigthey should have a ratio of one so crossaxis extend divided by main axis extentshould be one that means both should bethe same value and that's why it'sexceeding but in our case we don't wantthat if both have the same height andwidth that means it is a square andclearly we don't have a square over hereit's a rectangleso we can edit the value here and setchild aspect ratio to let's say 1.5 saveit and you seeit becomes shorter but still not enoughI still want it shorter so maybe I cango till 1.75and you might be satisfied with itbut I'm not I can say child aspect ratioto True 2 and this looks good in myopinion it looks brilliantso I hope you understood it we made itsuch that the mainsuch that the cross access extent isdouble the size or extent of main accessextentjust think about itchild aspect ratio is equal to crossaxis upon main axisif cross axis is 100then 100 divided by 50 will give us 2.so cross axis is double the extent ofmain axisso on Cross access you see it's this bigit's this big it's double the extent ofthis mean axisall rightso we have fixed the error over here andthis looks much better and it does feellike a web app which is perfectly laidout so yeah we have this and everythingabout it looks goodso I'm satisfied with what we have overhere in terms of responsive designso this was about the media query andthe power of media query media queryshould always be used whenever you wantto get the size of the screen the devicewidth or device height of the screenand to talk about the difference betweeninherited model and inherited widget byextending inherited model you can listento one particularproperty all right so in inheritedwidget let's say media query dot offcontext is calledand let's say the value of device pixelratio changed let's just assume okay thevalue of device pixel ratio changedbut in our app we are usingmediaquery.off context dot sizeso in reality the value of device pixelratio changed but this will still getcalled the build function will stillrebuild because that's what inheritedmodel or inherited widget do wheneverthere's a changethey will rebuild the entire build buildfunction and if they do thatunnecessarily my widgets are gettingcalledso this is what happens in inheritedwidgetyou can't listen to one particularproperty in inherited widget your ingeneral listening to any changes inmedia dot mediaquery dot off context andthen you're just saying that give me thesize it's finebut if device pixel ratio changes thisbuild function will get rebuilt for noreason at all because the size didn'tchange the pixel device ratio changedso this is just an example I'm notsaying pixel device ratio will changeand that will happen no nothing likethat will happenbut I'm just telling you and ifcondition or an edge case that canhappen and this happens in inheritedwidget with inherited model what you cando is Media query dot size of context oryou can do media query Dotdevice pixel ratio of context with thiswhat you've done is you're justlistening to one particular propertyyou're just listening to the sizechanges of the deviceyou're not listening to anything else atall you're not listening to the changesin device pixel ratio you're notchanging you're not listening to changesin some other property in media queryyou're just listening to the changes insize so this is what inherited modeldoes inherited model will help youselect one feature to listen to or oneproperty to listen to inherited widgetlistens to everything entire class allright so that was the difference andhere I am using size of context becauseI only want to listen to the sizecool now if I restart it will look thesame thing so now that we've talkedabout media query I also want to coverOne widget which is very helpful and Iuse it all the time when I want to makemy layouts and that is the layoutbuildup widgetso I'll remove media query from herebecause it'sdifferent from media query butin this case it is going to replacemedia queryso let's comment this thing outokayand what is this layout Builder widgetso first I'm just going to type the codeout then I'll explain what this layoutBuilder widget doessofor layout Builder widget I'm just goingto have layout Builder like this Builderwhich will give me contextand something known as box constraintsall right now we'll figure out what thisbox constraints is what this boxconstraints is is it gives us a bunch ofconstraints which we need to follow tolay out our appso if I just print stuff constraintsDot and let's say Max height which isthe mainthing then we have Maxwidth then we have minimum height andminimum widthall right and then we are going toreturn a text from your let's say andthat just says helloso nothing to fancy here and we see ahello nothing else a very simple text isreturned and you might think there is nopurpose of layout Builder but when youopen the terminal you'll seeconstraints dot Max height over here isinfinity constraints dot Max heightagain I don't know why we haven'tchanged it we want maximum widththen minimum height and minimum widthall rightnow we can restart again and we see overhere Max height is infinityMax width is 1440and minimum height and minimum width iszero what is this giving us well layoutBuilder gives us the constraints inwhich it is for example a certain widgetmight impose some constraint on us rightlet's say layout Builder is wrapped witha widget which is size box and has aheight of 100 width of 200 let's save itwe restart the app here you see theconstraints have changed now the maxheight is 100 Max width is 200 minimumheight is 100 and minimum width is 200meaning minimum and maximum width is 200what we have specified over here andmaximum and minimum height is 100 whatwe have specified over hereso what layout Builder does is it getsits constraints from the parent widgetsso whatever which constrains the parentwidgets give itit has those in its mind and it willtell us about those constraints that'swhy earlier when we didn't have anyconstraint at all it gave us Infinitybecause it can take how muchever spaceit requires then we add maximum widththe maximum width would be the width ofthis device and it is one four four zeroyou can check it for M1 Maxand then the minimum I hit and minimumwidth can be zero so you can make surethat yourwidget returned from your can be ofheightened with 0 or it can be anyheight or a width till one four fourzero so it gives you certain set ofconstraints According to which you needto followso that's what layout Builder doesit cares about what restrictions are puton itwhat constraints the container size boxpadding widget give to it so here we arejust going to take this constraints toknow what is the height and the widthall rightso we are just going to have ifconstraints dot maximum width is greaterthan 650so since it is a builder it is afunction at the end of the day we wantto return a widget but I'm putting an ifcondition over hereand since this is a function I can putan if condition like this if we were inUI I would put if condition like thisand there would be no braces all rightbut we are not in UI we are in a buildof function and in functionI have to put a curly bracket becausethat's what DART requires anyways if theconstraints.max width is greater than650 then I want to show a grid viewBuilderso let's return grid view Builder makesure to return itand as you can see when I save it itdoesn't format it automatically the coreformatting doesn't work because there'san error and this error is there becausewe have one if condition in place so ifconstraints dot Max width is greaterthan 650 then we return a grid viewBuilder okay but what if it is notgreater than 650 like our iPhone whatshould we do in that case then we willhave an else condition and there we aregoing to return a list view Builder solet's copy thisthen we are going to returna list view Builder sweet Also let's Proremove one pattern thesis make sureeverything is correct over here let'srestart the apps on iPhone Chrome andeverythingand we see an error over here and thesame error over herethat error is there because renderviewport and we have some boxing relatedproblemsso basically what we need to dois remove the expanded from grid viewBuilderand we've already removed the expanderfrom list view Builderthen we are going to wrapthe widget with expanded right now if wesave it everything shows up correctlyand even here everything shows upcorrectlyso expanded says take as much space andwidth as you require so here if we tryto print constraints dot Max heightand if we try to print constraints dotMax width we should be seeing a valuelet's restart we see 535 and 430 foriPhone and when we go to Chromeand restart we see 570. now the maxheight instead of infinity it is 570because that's how much space it isgetting because that's what expandeddoes right I hope you got a betterunderstanding of it through layoutBuilderand as the name suggests it helps you tobuild layoutsand the max width doesn't change becausethere is no constraint or there'snothing over herehowever Max height did changeso yeahwe just need to wrap expanded to layoutBuilder then we return a grid viewBuilder without expanded becauseexpanded is there for our layout Builderwe are getting the constraints properlynow and the same goes for listview buildup you're getting our constraintsproperly set up so this is layoutBuilder now you might ask what is thedifference between media query andlayout Builder the difference is Mediaquery takes the entire device width andthe entire device size no matter whatthe restrictions on the widget are butlayout Builder takes width and heightbased on the restrictions imposed by theparent widgets on it and that's why I'lllikely out build a better because youalways want to build your widgets basedon what the parent gives you whateversizing the parent will give you you needto follow that if media query doesn'tobey that then it's a problembut if layout Builderis telling you some constraints it it'sbecause of the parent constraints and weneed to follow that for example if Icome over here add to cart button let'ssay has some restrictions imposed by itsparent widget I shouldn't be using mediaquery dot size of context or mediaquery.off context dot size because thenI'll be taking the entire width of thescreenI only want to take as much width and asmuch height as my parent allows me to dothat's why layout Builder isused more often in my code I don't usemedia query that oftenin certain cases yes you do want thescreen width but in this case layoutBuilder works fine so we are usinglayout Builder I also hope youunderstood the Box constraints here itgives you the constraints you can havefor yourwidgets that you want to return and youcan check based on that also when youprint stuff herelike Max height and Max with presscommand Jrestart we get 517 and 1440 then I'llclick on inspectand then you seethe layout changed the height is stillthe same but the width decreasedso this is what I wanted to show to youand then we are getting an error overheresaying that hey this is not enoughso maybe we do need to set the childaspect ratio at 1.75and then it will work on all the screensizesI think it works till 1080 so we canpush it till 1080 so if constraints dotMax width is greater than 1080 widthso if you have this we have two cardsshowing up otherwise just one card okayso this works better I guess and as youcan see when I increasethis card also increases right if youjustcome over here a little bit over hereyou see the device or the card isshrinking initsheight and width but when I increase thewidth of the device it increases as wellso this is the beauty of child aspectratio you can configure it the way youwant it to work I think greater than1080 is fine because all laptops have awidth greater than 1080 at least I'mhoping that so yeah this was aboutlayout Builder and this is how it'sdifferent from media querynow you can play around with it and makethe weather appresponsive as well I didn't make itresponsive for this particular reason Iwanted to teach over here where we wouldhave better examples and then I wouldask you to do it for weather app andsend me the code if you want me toreview it I'll review it for youso this was all about responsive UI thatI wanted to share so to sum it up foryou try not to size your widgets becausemost widgets don't need an explicit sizegiven to it they don't need sizes like350 300 250 given to it they can take upthe space they need if you have a widgetlike list view Builder which needs theentire device height then you can usewidgets like expanded to give it all theavailable spaceand expanded is generally used in acolumn widget or a row widget if yourwidget does need a size however thengive it a height of let's say 40 100 150200 whateverbecause this height is in logical pixelsand logical pixels basically promisethat your widget will have the samephysical size on all devices so thismeans if your widget has a size of yourthumb on one of your device then it willhave the size of your thumb on alldevicesand the third option is to use a layoutBuilder or media query and I've alreadyexplained the difference between both ofthem to you so this marks the end of theflutter beginners course we've covered alot in this course but there's a lotmore to learn I wasn't able to cover allthe widgets as there are more than 200to 300 widgets and flutter the pointisn't to know about all the widgets it'sabout understanding how widgets shouldbe laid out how State Management and theflutter framework work if you'veunderstood that you're ready to buildapps on your own if you want to knowmore about databases you can watchInstagram or Reddit clone tutorialspresent on this channel so I hope you'vemastered the basics in flutter and youfound some value in this tutorial thankyou so much for watching and I'll seeyou in the next video\""
